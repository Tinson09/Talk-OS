No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
There.
You got something on your mind?
You have my word.  As a gentleman
She's not a...
Hi.
You know Chastity?
Well, no...
do you listen to this crap?
Wow
They do to!
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
Why didn't you tell me?
I just wanted --
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
What if she never starts dating?
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
No, but
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Why not?
You know French?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Number one.  She hates smokers
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
You makin' any headway?
Two legs, nice rack...
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Why?
Why'd you let him get to you?
I should do this.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Wholesome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
The duck?
Why can't we agree on this?
Was that your sister?
Which parts?
Bianca did what?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
You're completely demented.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
He's the devil's child...
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
I could be gone for years.
I haven't given you much of a life.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
What is it, now?  Tell me...
May I ask by whom?
How far from here?
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Father...
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
What do you see?
You come!  You speak first!
Chief says -- how many?
To bring the word of God.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Don't say anything.
I'm coming with you.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
What are you doing?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
A cop?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
What's he looking for?
Where is she?
Only one guys checked in?
Are you hit?
What's wrong?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Hmmmm.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You goin' to the escort service?
I don't have a girlfriend.
I'm serious here.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
So...who's Nicky?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Alright.
Alright.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Promise?
You promise?
Sooner or later that's everybody.
How old are your kids?
So what's unique?
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
Are you married?
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
We are both from Prague.
Who is he?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
How you erase this?
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
We started over, you can too.
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
New York.
A cheap hotel.
No.  Go ahead.
What was that?
Well, he killed my partner!
You okay?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Mouth's clean, too.
What??
What?
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
What are you gonna do?
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.

That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
You're kidding.
Hal?
It's the last one.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Yeah?
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
You're in a hurry.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
Where's ganz?
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
Luther was part of the gang?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Now, where we goin', convict?
I don't give out the details.
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
They saved your ass, convict.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Right, partner.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
No class...
That was in style a couple years back, man.
That was quick.
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
You okay?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
How did they get away?
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Bullshit red tape.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
Hey, you're right.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
You're impossible...
Hard man to live with.
Surprise, Luther.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Rosalie, you okay?
You want to go outside?
How about some ammo?
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
...would you like a drink?
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
You are a monster, Zorg!
Who are you?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
We have to save the world.
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Is there anything that can stop it?
What's she doing?
Yeah?
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
...Hello?
Hi Ma...
Hello?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Is that all?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
I'm not going.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Love...
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Uh...
Here we go again...
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Tell me...
Not going to open?
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
At least I won lunch.
The cash man!
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
This is all that survived?
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Drink!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
How's the detective business?
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
You should have.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What?
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
What are these?
Anything harder?
What are you talking about?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
A fellow investor.
You said something about money.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
You brought the money?
Excellent.
Friend of yours?
You're a dead man.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
What?
Who is this.
How much did he pay you?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You are a private investigator?
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
He's lying.
Big date tonight?
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Not quite.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
A daughter.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Uh huh, pleasure.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
Okay.
Hello?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
Why do you think he did it?
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
You've been up all night?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
You just feel sorry for me.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
So?
Been up with Alice.
What's wrong with me?
I'm sorry honey, but...
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
What?
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Excuse us, dear.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Where is he?
Hi, beautiful.
The tickets.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
About him?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
You think that's the place she's buried?
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I've got to write some of this down.
Mark, are you okay?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
I don't know.
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Is there any way out of it?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
As we near the Pole...
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
Yes.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
You see it?
He's on to us!
We bought you.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Guaranteed, eh?
I used to play ball.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
On your sleeve.
Saw him do it?
Open the door. We're late.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Yeah.
Why do they do that?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Was it funny?
But it's not funny now.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Pop?
How about a Big Mac?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Huh?
You don't want the extra police pay?
Huh?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
On what you pay me?
I won't. You interested?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
I'm sorry.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
You've been married twice --
Coffee's perked.
The other guy.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Rolfe.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Where's Ma?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Then who shot him?
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
Can we do that?
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Leave my daughter alone.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Twenty minutes?
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Finally, we can bargain.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
You know what?
I miss you. And I miss her.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
The fax machines.
Someone should give you a raise.
Did they say anything about my family?
who can I say is calling?
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
What's the story?
Did you feel that?
What is it, Mary?
Shut down accelerators.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
Elaine.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
Elaine!
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Roger.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
No.  Poached.  Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Striker.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Surely you can't be serious.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
George Zipp said that?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Rain.
Rats! I've lost number three.
Good-bye, darling.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
We have clearance, Clarence.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
You okay?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
He's not here.  Why ask me?
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Screw you.
Tell me.
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
Yeah... I know the routine.
Was.  Divorced.
What was that about?
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
Harcourt is dead.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
That where Anderson worked?
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
You got your vest?
Get outta there!
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
Ripley...
Amy.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
That's right.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
How do you feel?
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Save it.
The corner!  Ready?
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
They cut the power.
Range twenty meters.
Fifteen meters.
Cross my heart.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Are we going to sleep now?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Is there a part for me?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
Oh - excuse me!
No, she's fine.
Is she a good fuck?
Hardly.
And how will you make him keep it?
You have leave to try.
Why what, sir?
Why?
Stop it!
Do you think that's funny?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Yes!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Wolfi!
I don't know.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Who was that?
Why not?
Excellency!
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
These are originals?
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
What are you doing here?
How much will you pay him?
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Upstairs.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
My pleasure.
Do you like this, Salieri?
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Yes, what about him?
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Why are you here?
It couldn't be better.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Yes.
What's that?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Is he working?
Yes?
That's right.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
You burned the score?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
How long will you give me?
You mean she's not coming back?
No, please.
Shall I answer it?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Where did I stop?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Do you have me?
Oh? Have I seen it?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Mozart -
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Are they?
Is it true?
No? Was Mozart a good man?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
No, you didn't!
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Oh my son, my poor son!
He's setting that play to music?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
What does he want?
Herr Salieri.
How did he look?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
He's not?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch?
What shall we do?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
What shall we do?
What do you dream about?
I'm twenty-seven.
Now what do you want to talk about?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
I've left those pills for you.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
David, what are you doing?
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Hello, Benjamin.
No what?
Miss Price.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
All right, you two, move along.
Who is this girl?
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
There were witnesses?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
You're not having a good time are you?
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Okay.
Hello.
Say, David...
Heathcliffe.
It sounds far away.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
I'm not listening!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Jack, are you really dead?
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Because this must be stopped.
You were saying?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Yes?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Sorry.
No kidding?
Where's Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Charlie!
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
What good will that do?
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Fifty thousand dollars!
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
That don't do us any good.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I—
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Well, what?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
I'm not interested in what you think.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Excuse me—
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Good morning.
Why - well, I—
Oh!
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
No. I won't.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Hello, Helen!
What did you do with it?
No.
Yes.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
So you were home last night?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
How are you fixed?
We got a problem here, brother?
How'd they --
Corn gonna shoot at me?
But if we take their money and supplies...
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
What you sayin' boy?
How?
You shut up now, boy.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Where you boys going?
Thanks for the help.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
A bad idea.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Well?
I think one of 'em's glass.
Jesse.
Another dozen out back.
What?
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
You 'um big lawman?
Of St. Louis?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
They're gone. What are you --
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Such as?
Hell of a war.
"Big and older"?
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
How'd it go in there?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
We're drunk.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Riders --
Teasing you is completely unfair.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Let me see that.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
That's what I would have done.
You cocky little bastard.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
Now let's have a drink.
Really?
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
Really!
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Your men knew the risks.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Uh huh.
I can't.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Luis is a despicable twit.
Pull out.
What are you doing tonight?
That's nice.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Really?
Yes, darling?
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
He's rich.
I want a firm commitment.
We need to talk.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
No, no, no.
But where?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Are you sure?
I think you should go now.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Patrick? Is that you?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
I said we are totally booked.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
What is it?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Yes, Patrick?
Anywhere you want?
Interesting.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Forget it.
Jean? What?
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Bad habit.
Yeah...Yale thing.
Do you feel that way?
He had a yacht?
Actually, yes.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
That's so typical, isn't it?
Nothing.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
What?
No hash browns?
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
I've questioned him.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
I'm so hungry.
I lost my job...
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Speak up. Come on.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Shhhh...it's okay.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Is it over?
...But?
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
When's Brian coming for the TV?
That took some fun out of --
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
That was -- different.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Great!
You look beautiful.
Milo?
...wanna savor this.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
You're living here?
Will I get to work for Outpost?
That's gotta kill him, right?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
You know a lot about art, I guess.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
How's it going?
You did this -- overnight?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Gary, hi.
I'm okay. It's going well!
Gary, I --
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
This is good. Who did it?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
What?
...You wanna work -- here?
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Did I say something?
What've you got there?
Cool!
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
He's out of prison?
How close are you?
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Please don't go.
Meet me at the other location.
...He knows.
Latitude 47 degrees.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
What is it?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
You seem surprised to see me.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
To my health.
Yes.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Thank you, Basil.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Hello, Exposition.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
That does not compute.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
My wedding tackle.
Do I make you horny?
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Watch out, you're on my hair!
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Really, Austin!
Who?
Austin, what's your point?
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Kiss me.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Shut up.
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Quite impressive.
An evil vet?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
What did you say?
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
Did you ever...
Did you ever want to?
What do you want to do, Scott?
We don't label people here, Scott.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
... death ...
How long have I been here?
You
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Then you can't come in.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
How curious ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
The result would be ...
I didn't. Mother did.
Steed, we really must be --
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Not quite. This is my field.
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Where am I?
To kill me?
No, after you.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
I was getting to it.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Steed
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Insane ... ?
Why?
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
The last one you'll ever see.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
What?
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Great car.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Cole?
Cole, we've got to talk.
God, you're a slob.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
Um... that's very relaxing.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Let's go.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Great bathing suit.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Hookers beat you up?
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
It's on the tenth floor.
I'd love that.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
What the hell is that?
What are you going to do about it?
Reach out and snort someone.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Biggest in two battalions.
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
-- He killed people --
Why'd you come here, Brian?
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Brian, look --
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
It's okay, Stephen, I --
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
Brian.
I work for city hall.
Arson.
I could use a date.
Hi.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
I don't know anything about it.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What is --
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Oh Jesus Christ...
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
I need another one, sir.
Are you still here?
-- Shhh.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Read.
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
I don't guess.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Every little boy's fantasy.
I have a job.
Completely out of control.
What?
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
We gotta roll, Stevie...
They're waitin' man.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Sorry I hit Jackson.
Yeah? When was the last time?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Didn't think you'd make it.
Who's this?
You don't know him.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
-- Burn them.
It knows us. This one knows us.
Alderman Swayzak.
Inspector.
Don't you have any leads at all?
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Are you all right, honey?
So what are you doing here?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
I forgive you.
Oh, really?
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Yeah, him.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
What do you do?
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Seconds and thirds, too.
What's wrong with him?
De-la-croix.
Nice to meet you.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
How different?
You're now Mantan.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
The name of the show?
That's a great handle.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
This has to be a big mistake.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
Nobody told me anything.
How did you know?
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Hello.
You okay?
This is the group I was telling you about.
What is this?
For what?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Is that good or bad?
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
Don't make me have to use this.
Hi, Mona.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
No.
You know how your Daddy is.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Where are you from?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Let Myrna finish.
I never had a really real pair before.
Money and nothing else?
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
No, not that.  How 'bout...
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
I feel a song a comin' on.
So what's up with you?
You don't read, do you?
Why don't you call him?
You leave something out?
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
You want my heart?
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
I feel the ribbon.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
All the same, you must name an amount.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Does this assignment interest you?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Good night, papa.
Papa?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Charming Schuvaloff.
He is only curious to know who you are.
I don't want to go --
What about Pike?
You killed him you fucking faggot --
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
You too?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
You did Basic here?
Some.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
That'd be my reaction too --
I apologize --
He -- He made me do it --
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Where have you been, Jay?
Roberto, what the fuck?
You know it's not like that --
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
His chest was hamburger --
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
Is it the truth?
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Dunbar will testify that you were.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Tom, where are you going --
You think you could explain all this to me?
You're a good soldier, Bill.
Hostile and uncooperative.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Move him.
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
You made me look like an idiot --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Something like that. You?
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Buttfucks the cabin?
We're fucked, I know --
Are you sure?
We were close to something with Kendall.
Four --
No bodies, no West...
What?
You're a good man, Hardy.
Your phone number?
He was your friend.
How?
We should tell him we're not going.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Pike never confessed.
It won't work --
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
Thank God...
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
So?
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
What happens to Dunbar now?
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
Spooning the sherbet.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
Okay.
What did she say?
You're not trying to run away?
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
The one about the witch.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
You owe me three-fifty.
I thought you weren't dying.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Dad!
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
Tell me how it happens.
Let's get out of here.
Where are we headed?
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
Oh.
Daffodils?
How can I convince you to stop?
So what are you up to now?
You didn't become crazy.
I'm going to check on him.
You need to go.
Mmm.
Do you love your father?
How did you get here?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Was she one of your teachers?
That really happened?
Is he awake?
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
The sets were good.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
Do you like it?
You can see why it's sensitive?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
What did he say?
Hold on.
No.
Binoculars.
I understand. I'm so sorry
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
They go.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
So what are you going to do?
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
Excuse me?
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
I don't want to talk about it.
Some... What does that mean?
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You don't understand me.
Excuse me?
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
What?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Yeah. No thanks.
It's not mine.
No. What? No. I know.
You have excellent English.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Angela?
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
This was very sweet of you.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Hey.
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Still need a lift?
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
I deserve better than this.
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Where's Ronnie?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
You take it straight?
Still makin' jokes?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
How you feelin' today?
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
You need some weed?
Shit. Who hasn't?
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
What'chu sayin'?
He tapped that.
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Then what?
The hell is this shit?
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
I'm a what?
I feel better. Do you?
What happened to your face?
What's this?
What are they doing now?
Some party.
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Getting very weird.
Short shift?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
Nick!
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
I've continued working on the case!
How'd you get this?
Know her?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Did I say that?
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Yakuza.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
Nick!
It's very small.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
You'll get Ich killed.
One guy do all the damage?
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
I want a gun.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
Why tell me this?
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
Let's go while there is still time.
What's the point?
One man.  He must be good.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
But not to last.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
He could?
I think, therefore I am.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
You equipped for random questions?
But I would like to buy you drink.
Prosit.
I like you.
One more, eh?
How old am I?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
Nerves of steel.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
During the road test...
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Book the good ones for where?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
Are you for real?
I'd take him to the doctor.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
You use your equipment, don't you?
I can imagine.
How are you doing?
What do people do in the afternoon?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
But then how can you...
This feels stupid.
You're sick, Deckard.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Is this to be an empathy test?
What?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
You want to go home?
Whatcha doin'?
You look... better.
Twenty.
Methuselah Syndrome.
Hi!
Bravo!
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Get out of here!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
What's wrong with you?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
So far?
Do you own a car?
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
It's Perry!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
What?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Wait! Wait!
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Then forget it.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
Bites what?
It does?
You almost got us killed!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Where's he gone?
In the house?
The guy with the underpants!
Hey, Eve!
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Adam?!
I don't blame you!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
My pleasure.
Is that a birthday cake?!
Is this because of the radiation?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Like a painting?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
You're sure?
That's what everybody believes?
You have very nice ceilings.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
What's the capitol?
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
That would knock my father out.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Not on him.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
You bet!
What?
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
I don't see anything!
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Elbows, Son.
I'm afraid you've got to.
Yes?
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
No.
Oh, my God!
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
It's time.
You hear that?!
How long will we have to stay down here?
Days??
Thirty -five years!
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Calvin?!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Get the presents and do the lights.
What did you wish for, Adam?
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
He's smart.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
I forgot some of my stuff.
You came back for these?
Stop it, you two!
I don't know.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Go to the bathroom.
He go back to the hotel?
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
I don't think so.
What do you want to do with it?
What's wrong?
To get some frozen poultry.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
Wolf One -- say intentions.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Frank. Come in.
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Jeffrey?
Anything you can tell me?
What is this? What color is it?
Who knows you have these?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
That oughta do it.
Do you like that?
Do you like talk like that?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Yes.
I made it go down the toilet.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Don't say that.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
No. I should go.
Come in.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
I love you Don with all my heart.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
What?
He's comin' back? What for?
Hello, baby.
Where are we going, Frank?
No thanks.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
No.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Yeah, how did you know?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
What happened to him?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
What's the plan.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay, yeah, call.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Did you see her undressed?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Shoot.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Everything okay?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
What was that all about?
Really?
NO.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Yeah, well...
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Hello.
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
me up the...
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
Yeah?
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Right now.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Fuck you!
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Hello?
Roc. You okay?
No. You sure you're okay?
Roc. You okay?
No. You sure you're okay?
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
What is it my son?
Don't do this my son.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
She's really kind of hot.
I'm lookout.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Is that the manager?
Why not?
See if mine are in there.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
Inez, this is --
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
Which one was that?
He needs to hire an attorney.
He's gone. He stole the car.
When'd he tell you?
Where was I?
He told you and you let him do it.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I have an idea for that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Uh-huh?
I don't know.
What's happening? What's going on?
Freeze!
There's not enough time.
He did?
You got to be kidding me.
You think Applejack knew?
Does it float?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
That's a sharp jacket.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Are you afraid?
Absolutely.
Did you ever steal a car before?
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
See you.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
Anthony, I --
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
It's in the driveway.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Is that him?
They are.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
How much could you grow? Realistically.
What was that all about?
What did I say?
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
What are you doing?
How much is there?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
Is he chasing us?
Bob. Are you coming?
That could be anybody's.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
This could be a trap.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Everything OK?
I couldn't hear anything.
The elevator broke.
Do they let you --
Hold on --
Wait a second --
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
I might have mentioned it.
How you doing, Bob?
You keeping out of trouble?
He said you ran away from home.
How long do you have to go?
Is he good?
Why?
What's the story?
Where?
You like Chicanos?
No. Just pool.
You told me Bourne was dead.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
Treadstone.
That's not gonna fly.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Berlin!
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
She say what time I should call?
Show me again...
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
I have to go now.
Front. Use your teeth.
So why didn't you kill me then?
What do you want?
-- it's just him? --
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I wanted to kill him.
You hear me? I believed you.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
It's me.
Who?
Where am I?
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
-- go -- take the van! --
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Mr. Nevins?
Did you?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Does anyone know his politics?
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
What news of the north?
Wallace has sacked York!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
When will his trial be?
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
That's just a dream, William!
Keep these. We're going too.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
Where is my son?
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
I have faced him. Have you?
I do not confess.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
I've missed you.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
We can't stop!
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
All the dads are gonna be there.
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
Why do you ask?
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
What does that mean for Evan?
You're. Acting. Like your father.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
Books?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
Not since we were kids.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
Why are you doing all this for me?
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Come on, go on...
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Are you sure you even packed it?
What?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
What the hell are you doing?
Listen to me good, Evan...
Lung cancer?
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Good.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Here you are.
Here's to you, sir.
I'd better be going.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
You haven't heard my offer.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
A franc for your thoughts.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Why there is no other man in my life?
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
My German's a little rusty.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
I didn't count the days.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
I don't know the finish yet.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Put them on the table.
For the last time, put them on the table.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
But why my name, Richard?
I don't understand. What about you?
Yes.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
When will he be back?
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
You are very kind.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Yes, Victor, I was.
No, Victor, there isn't.
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
Yes.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
Good morning.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
But we made a deal.
Yes.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
I believe you have a message for him?
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
This is hardly the time or the place.
And that is?
Even in Berlin.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
Hello, Louis.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
I was misinformed.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Victor Laszlo.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Is that a serious offer?
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Oh, it's my party.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Will I see you tonight?
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Rick! Rick, help me!
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Can't.  Need water.
Thirsty.
No.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Get water!
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
It's real.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
How was Russia?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
He is a cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
No.
That's your dog.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
If you say you are.
Need some help?
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
You what?
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
Cool ropes.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
That's all there is.
Take your time.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
Thanks.  For everything.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
What'd she die of?
I've never seen a lobster.
I know.
Oh...
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
You don't miss it?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
I love you, Wally.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
That's a heavy sedation.
I just wanted to ask you...
But did you know him?
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
I'm stayin', Homer.
First pregnancy?
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
Do you like to read?
You okay, Rose?
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
They told me I was too old to serve.
Don't this place look like home?
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
*What* view?
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
This has to happen fast.
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Grifters...
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
We were back on.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
So we go to the bar.
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Masters of our own destiny.
It can buy you a new and better you.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
Calls?
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Listen, Scooter --
Look at you, you skinny prick.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
What about... The money?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
What the hell's his problem?
You need to get a haircut.
I don't trust anyone.
Uh... Everything okay?
I gotta go get a haircut.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
How do you know I will?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
What about...
You got my cell. Leave a message.
Yeah.
It's bad luck.
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
Him.
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
Still time.
Who?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
You sell it.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
What are you doing?
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
My car's in the garage.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
What kind of deal you looking to?
What?!
All right. As what?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
I found her in bed with someone.
Good night?
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
I want to hear it.
It came my way. 450 a week.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
The door, Jack.
That girl, she works at the casino --
Why did you take the money?
So how are you doing, dad?
I've lived there.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
But if it does.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
I want you to forget what I said.
Would you like a drink?
How are you?
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
Rough day?
What happened to Bella?
Where did you go to school?
Ever?
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
You can start Monday week.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
The key!
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
What was that, I didn't hear...
Fuck that shit.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
It is intuitively obvious.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
And you can only do it once, right?
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Commander Powell would have named it.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
TALBY!
You know what I think about, Talby?
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
What happened, Doolittle?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Commander? Are you still there?
We're running out of time, sir.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
What are you doing here?
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
Which is none of your business...or mine.
What're you looking for?
I'll make it worth your while.
What a creep.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Soon, baby.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Girlfriend?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
You said you could help.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
You believe that?
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
With your help.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
I think you should go now.
This is not a place you wanna go.
Say the words, "I understand."
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
Thank you.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
As long as you're okay.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
And she bought that?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Really?
And you were a sympathetic ear.
And why should she?
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Whoa... she is a killer.
No problem.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
Ann Arbor?
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
Sunday, but...
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
No... You don't think...?
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
They're not idiots.
What?!
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
It's gone.
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Gimme your gun, boy!
Good morning, mongrels!
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Beg pardon?
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
How can you do that?
What happened to your eye?
Why do they call you Frank?
Wanna walk me home?
So... you just moved here?
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
That was a compliment.
Where are we going?
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
My mom is gone.
What?
No. Frank.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
So how was school today?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Oh, shit!
Grandma Death.
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
Follow him where?
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
Nothing.
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
I think now that he might...
How is that possible?
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Where is she?!
You're what?!
You-betcha.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Loretta, don't do that.
Oh, Amber...
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Go on! Get out!
Bye mom.
What?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Here, I didn't get any.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
We was robbed.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
Wisconsin.
The bitch.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
So help me, Gladys.
Oh! What is it?
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Yes -- why?
What's the matter with you?
Hey you!!
What kind of a dog is he?
Then I demand an apology!
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
You no gotta no gun.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
Once more! 
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Was it -- swine?
What'll I do with this card?
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
But -
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Did it go well, darling?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
Yes.
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
Like this. 
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
Don't!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
What happened?
This man belongs in hospital.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
I want him back!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
You've acquired a taste for this?
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
Oh yes?
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Has the response picked up?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Romance!
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
How awful for John.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
You alright?
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Yes!
John... Merrick
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
Righteousness for his namesake.
You look splendid, John.
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Good morning, John.
...my... home?
You did this for me?
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Very smart indeed.
A dressing bag?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
WELCOME?
What's the matter?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
But you LOVED her all the same...
We mustn't let him land!
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
Do you believe I love you?
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
But you don't want to hear it.
Really.
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
About NOT raping you...
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Is THAT Odin?
"But" what?
What are you talking about?
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
We're missing all the fun...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
What are YOU doing here?
It's magic.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
No! Let go, Snorri!
What do you think?
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Hey, you two! What's going on?
I AM one, Dad!
She hasn't got any.
Hy-Brasil?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Yeah... well...
It can't do you any HARM...
You know, my son, our lord said...
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
Let me go, Sven.
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Well! Come on!
Get away, Snorri.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
Can't make enough axe-heads!
My brother blacksmiths!
Wasn't it, Keitel?
It's a tradition.
Well, of course he is!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
How are you today?
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I don't have one.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
I'm not a stalker.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Take care.
What do you want to hear?
No. I --
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Let me drive you home.
How can you watch this crap?
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
Oh, thank God. It's going.
Oh?
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
We did talk about Naomi.
It's very late.
Probably.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I think, before.
When?
Listen, did you want to make love?
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
A bully? Moi?
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
I don't know. Panties and --
How's it going?
It was snowing.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
Clementine.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
How's the chicken?
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Clementine.
What? What do you mean?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
What?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Hey.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Does that help?
It's an apartment.
Yeah?
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
You're political, then?
Extraordinary!
I'm cold.
Thanks.
So now you're bummin' around?
But Countess...
Holy shit...
How? The Bridge is gone.
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Please...
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
What, Justin, what shows you?
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
This is Weir.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
We've got pressure.
Peters is right, no one's here.
Peters...
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
If it worked.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
It's 2041...
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
Where has it been for the past seven years?
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
You... You can't do that!
Heading three-three-four...
Captain Miller...
Smith, get out of there...
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Oxygen is not the problem.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
Weir can't be alive.
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Can you see a body?
We have to do something, oh God...
You got any coffee?
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
You look like an eighties rock band.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What are you doing here?
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
What about his first born?
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Isn't that your speech?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Are you alright?
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
He's not responsive --
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Apparently I can disappear.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Then what is it?
How's the IPO?
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Feeling better?
Which was?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Ben did this?
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
What are you doing here?
But I'm not done with the machine --
What are you doing?
Please don't make this personal --
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
I can't find it, mon!
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
I'm just guessing.
I don't know. I was just curious.
You are a virgin!
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Any problems?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
Pick a suit.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
What's going on?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Take that back.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
It's definitely your mama.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Poor guy.
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
Who's that?
Are you going to ride that wave?
He is.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
That's him! He did it!
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Well I never did it.
You'll always remember your first time.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
It couldn't be.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Where's Doug?
You better save some for me, you swine!
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
What's that?
If you graduate.
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
I think I better take you home.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Where's your brother?
No. That's okay.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
...I've got to go home.
Where's Mike today?
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Let's have lunch!
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Rum and ice, please.
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
Naw!
He wanted the pineal gland.
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Where'd you get that knife?
Jesus.
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
Lucy.
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
This is a fucking nightmare.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
Extract of pineal!
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
In that case, maybe she can help.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
Where are you two going?
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
You got something better?
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
Where's the tunnel?
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Scared?
We're better off.
Why do you take shit from him?
Your brother, huh?
We gotta be close.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
How much you got to see the show?
He's dead.
Huh?
Keys.
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Bullshit.
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Hey!
Let's wait it out.
Okay, well that's something.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
What did we say about lying?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
What're you doing?
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Get your clothes on, lady --
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Were you a drug addict?
Of course.
...So what do you think?
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
See you next weekend?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Aren't you ever going back?
What?
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Well? What'd you think?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
How ya doin', Farmer?
Jesus.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
What for?
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
To quarter-horses.
I love you, Harry. I love you.
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
That would be okay.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
...Is that not true?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
'But how do I know you love me?'
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
I'll have lunch ready by one.
At one. Promise?
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
No!
You're not going anywhere!
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Oh! Are you really?
...Did you really say that?
Is there something else?
You what?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Huh?
Symington says...
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Come warm yourself if you like.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
This was not taken from a grave.
She's beautiful.
Poor William! What indignant tears!
I should go. I should leave today.
Are you all right?
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
What kind of God is He to will this?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
I give you my soul...
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
Professor?
Henry Clerval.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
You're making a scene!
You can't. Death is God's will!
That's blasphemy!
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
Are you sure you'll be all right?
I have always loved him.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
Your men are right to be afraid.
What'd you see?
Good night, Alice.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Oh, my God...
You can only do what you can do.
Help you clean up?
It sounded like Brenda.
You said we were special.
Somebody's there, Barry.
Let's go back, Barry...
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
Roll him over!
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
Holy shit...
Ha!
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
How much do I owe you?
I mean...
How many with you?
What is your purpose in Mexico?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
What's this guy's problem?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Where is the little lady?
Was? As in not anymore?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Then?
Why are you so agitated?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
What do you think Mom would say?
Not good enough, swear to God.
Watch my back!
Hot goddamn day!
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
Yeah?
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Do they have a waterbed?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
They're gonna search the van.
Keep your voice down.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
I'm lookin' scared?
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
The woman I saw you with...
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Permission to leave, sir?
Fine by me, sir!
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
You know him.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
You don't know that.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Time.
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
No shortage of suspects.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'd sure like to know who.
They're more afraid of you.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Do you, uh, know...
32 feet, six inches!
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Got it.
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
We're fucked.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
Subject?
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Where's Audrey?
Animal, I can't.
What are you doing?
He's not going to do it.
I'll take them all.
So you made it.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
My life sucks.
Did Romeo have a name?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Wish me luck!
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
We know.
I need you to trust me.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
I think we should leave now.
What'd they say?
Hello?
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
"The show must go on."
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
What the hell is going on?!!?
He wants to THINK!?
What's happened?
Alex you can't -just leave.
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
I don't know.
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Go. They're off again.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Systems register functional.
Covalent... Right. So...
No, I'll kill you. .
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
Where are the miners?
I am SO SICK of being right.
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
Hi everybody.
They're gone.
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
There's nobody here. Jason...
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
You're playing your good side.
Clenched jaw...
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
Unbelievable.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
We.. We lie.
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
Where?
Hold course, Laredo!
Continue forward, sir?
WHAT? WH
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
What's your frank estimation of the British?
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
Is that a fact.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
Wil...
Well, what have you thought?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
What is this?
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Oh, come now...
You think that?
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
Like flowers after the snow melts.
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
Surely you knew this was coming.
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
You're out of your mind!
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
You get the money?
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
He's around someplace.
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
Get something going there.
In just a second. Two...
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
I don't know.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
You say look at you?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You have a card in here?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
I want you to.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
For a movie?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Yeah. That was a good party.
We talk different?
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One we're producing.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
We call you a taxi.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
I got you a copy of the script.
I think it's not horrible.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -–
You sure?
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
Whatta you doing out there?
Yeah, but whose point of view?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Hello, Doris.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
What's wrong?
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Lufkin. His... agent.
But you are interested?
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
You think the extra strain caused it?
What's so great about Sweden?
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
One more?
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Last thing we want is extra partners.
What other choices have we got?
Smokes?
If you get it back in one piece.
But how long?
What about running number two by itself?
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Bodies're too fresh.
That'd be my guess.
Dodge to Murphy.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
What?!
What the hell happened!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
That's a good thing?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Coffee?
What'd you find up there?
Are you sure?
Got your light?
It's not gonna hold us.
What do you think happened on this boat?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
What do we do with him?
What do you think?
They went crazy.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Let the buyer beware.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Murphy, goddamit.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
We're still drifting.
He took the shotgun and a light.
What's this?
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Someone from the past.
Maxine.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
What?
About what?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Hmm.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
Do you want something to drink?
Nothing.
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Why?
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
You know, the green cardigan guy.
You're better at it.
It's obviously him!
What's going on now? What's he doing?
This is way too creepy.
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
"Funky"?
What? How long have you been standing there?
We still have to go in there sometime.
Where are we going?
There he is...
I totally, totally hate you.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
You're gross.  See that guy?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
Now are you going to get a regular job?
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
What? When did you see Josh?!
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
Wow... finally.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Fine, and how are you?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
How much is it?
Wow!
Yeah, sure, I guess...
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
I don't think so...
Yes, that would certainly do...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
What, are you a klansman or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Never...
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Boo!
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Well when can we do something?
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
Just someone so young...
In what way do you mean?
What's up?
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
I hate sports.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
What do we have here, Margaret?
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know.
Thank you, doctor.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
I am a man of peace.
Starting now, we attack them.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
Second death? Where?-
Actually, no.
Have you got it?
Samuel says you killed a lion.
...misfire... it jammed...
Think about something else.
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
Why do the workers look unhappy?
Soon. 
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
His name is Oscar.
That's where the buggy stopped.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
What now, Brainiac?
That's a thousand million electron volts.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
Rivers of the stuff!
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
And now you're going to eat it?
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
What's your story, Pete?
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Does it have any favorites?
You got a flux and a half.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Tell him about the toaster.
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
Ready?  What is it?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Uh-huh.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Can't you tell me now?
You must have gotten the last copy.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
That is one speedy mutt.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Circle?
Nervous?
Yes?
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
All right.  I'll try.
Where's the Keymaster?
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Sorry, Buddy!
It's working!
I've got to sleep.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
I told you it's real.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
So do I.
Ray -- Something's here.
Third floor.  Get down here,
How do you know?
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
That's what you told me two days ago!
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Where is my family?
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Caesar, ignore them.
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Where are they?
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
Serious stuff...
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
What about their philosophy lessons?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
Narcissus!
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
I want to go home.
What is the matter?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Did they ever find out?
All right.
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
I want to ask you a question.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Let me go.
Why?
Please let me go.
Don't tell me --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
The marble?
What are you going to do now?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
657-2036
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
What's that?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
Mr. McCleery?
What for?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
BENJAMIN?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Well here's the purse.
I'd rather not.
Where are you?
Is anything wrong, sir?
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
In general.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Thank you.
Will you come in, please?
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
What do you think of me?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Oh my God.
What do you think?
Yes?
I think I'll go to bed.
Won't you unzip my dress?
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
But they would! Don't you see?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
What?
Yes, I do.
Hello, Benjamin.
He didn't see me.
Did you get us a room?
Well -- goodbye then --
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
You're not interested in art?
Can I take off my clothes now?
Do you really want me to?
What?
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
How many times a year.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
Why did you do that?
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
What kind of car was it?
Really. I want to know.
Good.
No.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
This is absurd.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Drive down the block.
Mrs. Robinson --
How?
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
They don't know?
When did you two talk this over?
Well --
Why?
Say that again.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
What?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Hello.
No, I don't.
Is anything wrong?
The Carlsons' are here.
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
Time's getting short.
I want to speak --
And what are you going to do?
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Like dancing?
You?
What?
We'll dance.
You live here?
Nothing -- only to be here.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
Yes -- tired...
What can you see?
And?
And what do you do -- now?
There.
So --
I'll go -- good-bye.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Very early in the morning.
I'm worried about you.
Till then.
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Well -- last night was not so good.
The war.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
For me?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
Telegrams?
Any letters?
Oh -- but -- I --
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Dance then? 
Please -- please!
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Am I!
What...! --
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
What is this?
You...
Skiing? 
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Of course -- of course. 
Can you pay some attention to me?
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
All right.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
You're calling the shots.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
Don't mention it.
What happened to your hand?
Up to you.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
For God's sake, Lilly!
Well, uh...
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
Where's the five?
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Get well soon.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
Is that right?
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
He retired.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
I don't think I need it.
Don't I get any say in this?
Sure. Let's get it over.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Where?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
No.  Wait for the police.
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
You're twisted.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
It's an option.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Not me.
I can see that.  Why?
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Still wants to move out?
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
What's this?
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Mom -- Who is this?
Whatever happened to women in back?
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
You've been watching too much TV.
Mommy, I'm scared.
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Promise?
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
See what I'm talkin' about?
I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
What now?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
You've created a monster.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Miss me, baby?
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
Home.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
You know what gets me?
How short the skirts are.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
We got to get another pilot.
What went wrong?
Ask it!
Life has denied me that thrill.
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
Excellent!
No.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Oh hell.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Dad--
That's a rifle you have?
Some kind of animal?
What's the matter?
What's that all about?
Your old beau?
We all are.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Please--
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
Which one?
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
That's what you're supposed to say.
It couldn't!
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
Two hundred years old.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
He's a child!
You're begging him to kill you?
Honor, I suppose.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
None.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
There's a certain amount of information there.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
You're old--so old.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
The new hero is you.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
Don't shoot.
Thank you--for my life.
I dunno, boy.
It was a bitch.
Because he was cruel?
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Thank God!
No.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
Not true.
I hate that thing.
Where will you be?
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
I don't get it.
My father!
It's fine!
I hate that thing.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
I see.
Is he coming home?
What was it?
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
This is very good for us.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
I wish Paul luck.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
You fool, you fool.
Is that a fact?
You've got to fight from time to time.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
No. I don't think so.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Yeah.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
What do you mean?
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Are you the star of this picture?
It's your money. You talk.
Joanne?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
I thought you were going to bed?
You won't keep growing at this rate.
You know what I'm talking about.
Neither am I.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
More or less.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Andy.
Mast?
I've got a meeting...
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
They're legal now.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Do the police want to arrest me?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Hey man.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What you got in mind?
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
It's an investment.
Jake.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
And what are you studying?
Lady, let me get this straight.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
And what do you do, my dear?
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
A block of ice.
Eh, no.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Yes.
Yearse!
All right.
How about some ginger pie?
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Me! No. Of course not.
It goes on and on.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You don't look eighty.
Why do you say that?
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
What's that?
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
I like Glaucus.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
No. I'd feel stupid.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
That wasn't very scary.
You sure have a way with people.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Supper for two.
It's all right. It's organic.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
How do you do?
Oh, is this your father?
Just give me a rough estimate.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
And a lot of time.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
How about to slit his throat?
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold, calm down! This is...
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
He... he loved me.
It's coming.
What do you mean?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
Well... G'bye.
Wait!
Nonsense, I...
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
They were over here, Professor.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
You are a Catholic??
Here. You'll need one of these.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
What the hell was that? An ape?
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
I worry about you.
Don't look! Turn around.
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
Sir, may I go first??
That voice --
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
Whatcha looking at, John??
What took you so long?
What was that??
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Are you sure about this?
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
That you feel that way about me.
Hit me.
You fucking ass-holes.
Will you sign for the bed?
That your daughter?
Lucky man.
No time for argument.
We want the man who did this --
You remember.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
No.
But you said --
Don't look at me.
...somebody...
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
Don't you care?
Maybe we should just leave --
Sure.
It smells damp.
You're still blaming me.
All right.
No argument.
Larry!
What have you done?
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
What's wrong?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
Well, isn't it?
Is this your place ?
No personal details?
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
You wouldn't believe me.
Who's there?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
Big house.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
You know I do know the way home.
Not that late.
What do we do if there isn't?
I see.
I beg your pardon?
These THINGS... they want to take me --
What's wrong?
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
Play it.
Not the point.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Hey.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
What?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
Uh.  That's me.
Oh.  Okay.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
What's this?
Are you all right?
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
I dunno.
Hi.
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
What's the obvious stuff?
Did you say something?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
It sounds stupid.
Is it better?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Will you call me?
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
Hello.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Are you still in love with me?
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
Hello.
Who the fuck's Pig?
You're soaking.
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
When are you going back?
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Laura...
Let's go home.  Okay?
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
More confident, maybe.
Nothing.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
No.  Probably not.
About what?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
And after that?
What do you think?
But you must have --
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Thirteen hundred.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
How old is Richard?
I warned you.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Someone beat you.
I have friends.
He tried to kill me last night.
He called you "MacLeod".
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
What about me?
I'd rather hear yours.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
What's all that?
Maybe it would do us both good.
You're using your son's name.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
Who are you?
I haven't killed _you_.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
What is it?
Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
Forget it.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
Good way to lose your job.
Stop.
Aye.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
You're wrong.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Complete your inspection?
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Yeah.
Any other I.D.s come up?
The last four.
Spare a chair?
And have you something to settle with me?
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
Friend of yours?
This your present address?
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Morning Mr. North
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Are you back?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
Oh, it isn't like that.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
Too hot?
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
All right, dear.
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Did you finish the interview?
Did you give her the money?
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Mother? But your mother --
Just for the first year.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
I'm beginning to realize that.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
What do you want?
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Done what?
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
You've had a better offer, eh?
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Thanks...
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
What do you mean?
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
Where do you think you're going?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
All the words you've got.
Hildy!
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
What happened?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Hello -- hello...
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
No, you don't! Walter!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Well -- what is it?
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
How about Bruce's?
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Sure, boss.
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
There's money in it, Cooley.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
I don't know --
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Hold the phone!
What a chase!
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
No -- just coffee, Gus.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
What went off?
For who?
Just one second --
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
Got you, Williams!
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
You fight it cut.
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Come on with that money!
Where's the money?
Kings and sixes.
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Mother!
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
What's the idea?
Hey --
What's from the Governor?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
Is it hard?
They wouldn't take it.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Get the cops, somebody.
What's your hurry?
What's that?
Can I try?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
Give him the you-know-what.
Only till they get you into the local school.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
You're the biggest fibber.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Where?
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
We all had to write a last letter home.
Has Sue got it right?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
What did he say?
Is it peace in out time?
It was the best time of his life.
I can't do it. What's the point?
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Thank you.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
He walks, duh.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Come on, bro. Let's go.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
But suppose for a second you did.
She's pretty cute.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
She looks like she stinks.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Go around him.
Hey, he moved.
Forget it. I'll just go.
Check this out.
How's about you give me those same directions.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Huh?
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Jesus Christ.
That's the understatement of the year.
God damn.
What'd ya got there?
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
Grampa... watch the language.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
What about the body you found?
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Tell him, Harold.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
My little French.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Yeah? What?
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Please. Just one minute of your time.
What?
No.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
Very well.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
He's dead.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals. Loves you.
My brother is discreet.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Be still my crotch.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
How'd you know where I was?
Done!
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
What SPF, sweetie?
Flares?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Who is it?
Who from work?
It would just be helpful to know.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
How's work?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Ugnh.
Yes.
Boys just passing through?
Pittsburgh?
About sixty, seventy bucks.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
I'm ready.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
I want to talk to you.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
Are you ready for another?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
Could be.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Hey, mister.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Hello, Eddie.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Thinking about what?
What's that supposed to mean?
Sure.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I can beat him.
I'll beat him the next game.
Tell her what?
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
You name it, we shoot it.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Whaddya mean?
Quit. He's too good.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
With what?
Oh yeah? Where?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
That's right. When?
What time?
There it is. I'm broke.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Gimme ten bucks.
You better not miss, friend.
Long wait for a bus?
Yours.
Can I sit down?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
Why?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
You got it all in your head?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Eddie, what's in that case?
No, why should I? It's yours.
What are you writing?
Who is it?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
No. You?
Well, he owns things.
No, I want to walk.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Your shot.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
You name it.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
What about... now?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Why don't you start with me?
I don't know.
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
I surrender --
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
So, what do you do?
Bathroom?
Son ... are you awake?
We're going to be moving, son.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
There are more this year than last.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
I had an awful dream.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
We were having a little talk.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
I swear it was here.
They'll get us.
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
When?
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
You're being paranoid.
David? How'd you get this number?
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
You still believe in him.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
Then what?
Pops!
Not listed, huh?
Dad, please...
This I can see.
What the hell are you doing?
Get us out of here!
What're you doing?
Is my wife in the air?
Where are they?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
How're we doing?
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
Really? You don't mind?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
You're late.
You scared the hell out of me.
So, what do you do for a living?
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
But I gave you some this morning.
How' he doing?
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
Why did you people come here?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
What do you want us to do?
Yes.
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
That doesn't look much like a library.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
It would make me very happy.
The Ark of the Covenant.
At least I let you tag along.
No. You like the way I do things.
This one. I think he's in here.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Dad!
It's important!
Through the library?
They want my diary.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
Stop!
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Well... I can't think of anything.
Those people are trying to kill us!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Ready?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
And why were you trying to kill me?
Interested in local curios?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
What?
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
That was a misunderstanding.
You have insulted my son.
What's that?
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Indy?
I ride with you, Indy?
What you look at, Indy?
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
That's far enough!
Give me the stones!
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
You all right?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Can you move your arm?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
Any more complaints?
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
What is it...?
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
I want to go home...
So now they believe me.
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
Anymore ideas...?
The last Sankara Stone.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
I said something.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
Al.
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I told you, my name is Al.
You've heard of the PEM114...
Are you threatening me?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
What for?
Did you hear that?
JOE Or what?
Yeah...Who is?
What do you mean we.
Door's locked.
Which way do I go?
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
I'm back.
You mean...just leave.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Eating sushi?
Eat it?
It's sand.
Al, are you doing anything in there?
Beautiful!
What happened?
Where are you going?
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
Yeah. I did it.
You really like that shirt?
Get close to them.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Just don't show fear.
They're all in it.
You're doing great with her.
And on my time.
Osaka.
Come on, she's getting away.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
...drink it.
What next!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I don't trust her.
It's him.
He hung us up dry.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Do something.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
You're a lucky man.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
Awwww...
What are you doing?
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
I'm against it.
Can you fly this?
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
You have nothing...
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
What Job?
Sir?
What are you doing here, where've you been?
I don't want to intrude.
When you do...
Right.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Take the card.
Who?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Ahhh...nothing.
Don't do it!
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
The poet...something he said...
Blake said that?
I can't do that?
What way?
And you?
You again.
Promise you what?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
And how'm I doing?
Who do you work for?
Why did you leave?
Why?
Were you working for him last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
What's Gruner like?
Who was?
And Dieter.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Why'd you ask him.
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Are you alright?
What did you tell them?
Now what?
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
How?
Now what?
Don't worry.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
What's new?
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
We gotta hook up.
P.J.'s.
Push it.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
What are you cooking?
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Yeah?
...taping?  What are you taping?
Use the bathroom.
Thank you, Bob.
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
No classes this morning?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What?!
Jeffrey Wigand...
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Yeah...
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Yeah, I'm here.
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
Look, I really don't have that much time...
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
...okay.
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
Yes.
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
You attract a crowd.
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Did he hear you?
What about now?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
What do you mean there is no family?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
Poor communication skills.
"I would bet on it."
Object!
Jail?
Is that a threat?
You threatening my family, now, too?
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Baby. You are so HOT!
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
You're in a rush.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
It was a gift from a client.
Who was that?
What is your husband's profession?
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
What is it you're after, Miles?
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
He's passionate.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
To victory.
Marylin? When did I say...?
Screw you, asswipe!
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I want to be your -- your wife.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
You do?
Honey, I could sit...
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
I have a surprise for you.
Comfy!
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
I fell in love Miles.
Wait! He works for YOU?
You were going to have this thug...?
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Who's that?
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Wow.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
You're not...
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
Is this Ming?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
What?!
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
That's delusional.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
And it's good!
Where does that leave us?
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
How is she?
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me—those things give me a stiff pain.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
We'll go into that some other time.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
What've you got against King Westley?
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
Ridiculous!
Are you going to see him?
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
You talk as if—
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
We've done that already.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
No.
Oh, yeah?
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
I beg your pardon!
No. I'd rather you didn't.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Here, boy!
Now, just a minute—you can't—
Darn clever, these Armenians.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
That, I suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
Who are you?
Here—
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Detectives!
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
This isn't "piggy-back."
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
But what!
Carrots.
You! Don't make me laugh.
What about money?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
No harm in your coming to see us.
Where's the bus to New York?
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Yeah, where am I?
What do you reckon that's for?
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
You send telegrams here?
There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—
Then—you'll have to git !
Huh?
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Bill.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
You know you keep saying that.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Did he pay you for this?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
Why?
...Oswald?
You know damn well who it is.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Why?  What's wrong?
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
What about Ruby?
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
That's our case!
Dad, look what I drew.
I want the truth.
...you heard echoes.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
No.  Never heard of him.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Hi.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
What's wrong, Lou?
Oh no!... How bad?
I know David - a strange character.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
Can we find her?
Goddamn Sam!
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
Time?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Jim Garrison?
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
And he never hit you before?
How much more?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
Do you walk home?
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
That requires me goin' out tonight?
And you didn't tell the Police?
What's she want?
She knows it's my case?
Can I have a word with you?
Help us do what?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
I gave you my card there.
You're not tired of it?
What have they told you?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
No, you didn't. What branch?
He's the one who wants you.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
If you're having some.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Want to hear some music?
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
How do you feel about getting old?
Really?
It's different with men.
Does something else worry you?
Does it happen to all men?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
You talk them into it?
What about you Max?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
And is that it?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
It'll be more than that.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Where's the rest of it?
Then you're out and you get nothing.
How'd you find out?
Where're you going?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
He say is a surprise.
We'll just be a minute.
How can you help us?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
She didn't say.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Ever been tempted?
That would be one point of view.
What did you do after that?
There was a guy with Melanie?
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
What about you?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Killian's.
Uh-uh.
How long you been with Ordell?
You think I'm kidding?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
What do you think it is?
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
That's the idea.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Plus the same deal as before.
I was there, I saw her do it.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
Want a hit?
Is it ready to go?
You okay?
Which one?
Were you a disco girl?
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
I'm carrying it.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
I'm going to wait in the car.
How much is there?
What's your relationship?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
How long was she in there?
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
I'm going out for a few hours.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
Ten thousand sounds high.
What's his full name?
Beaumont Livingston.
You didn't hear?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Uh-huh.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
He's around.
Get me out of here.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
What do you want?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
You're hurting me!
You know, you got a strange line here.
Hello.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
There was a bang.
It's cold.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Jake, you need to rest.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
What was that?
I'm not cold.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
She was good in bed, though.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
Jacob, what can I do?
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
What happened to you?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Can't you stop it?
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
What'd the doctor say?
He's coming right over.
Don't gimme that.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
I know.
How come? The army?
While you were in the shower.
Who else were you expecting?
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
Who was that?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Please.
Where are they?
What's going on?
I don't know you.
Oh God!
Goddamn you!
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Where's Wong?
How was Palm Springs?
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
This is not a dream! This is my life.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Still married, Jake?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
The army?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Okay, enough of this shit.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
What are you doing?!!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
What's that?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Better let me.
Done!
Goodbye, my love.
We'd need charges.
Then what do we do?!
Hurry!
It bought us some time.
Earth II.
Boeman, the ships not here.
You're a teacher.
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Sergeant!
Jesus, God!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Where is everybody? What happened?
Pull me in!
Rizzo?!
What's this?
See? We're not so bad.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Rizzo, pull away!
You okay?!
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I'm missing two!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
You're so bossy.
What are you doing?
Kay-em you okay?
Leave him behind!
Something's wrong.
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
I gotta go back.
I'm sending you the files.
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
More soldiers?
Guys, he's right behind us!
Son! -- Out of the water now!
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
You got it?
The wire's showing!
I never saw one that big.
Did you get him in the head?
Probably out in the back yard.
Be careful.
It's three feet deep, Martin
How come you have to tell them that?
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Home... New York?
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
Got a pen on you?
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
Where'd you get all this?
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
I hope we get some more help.
What the hell?
What day is this?
Think the tide's with us?
You picked her up on the ferry.
Think she might've run out on you?
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Would you like something? Some coffee?
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
Well... is everything all right?
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Coming right to us!
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
You know how I feel about her.
What's up?
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Wait, let me take that.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
I try really hard, actually...
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Just like our moms and teachers!
What? I'm not made of stone.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
Cool it.
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Yeah.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
Well, it can really only go two ways.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
The Wizard of Gore?
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Yeah, she does.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
No way! She's pretty.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
She answered our prayers.
Have you found a place to stay?
...Pardon?
What?
Are you takin' the pictures?
Is it hard to learn?
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
You took this picture?
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Adele... are you serious?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
Carryin' a gun.
What?
Shush, Adele.
What the hell is this stuff?
...I don't know.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
So what do you do Early?
Can't hurt.
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
That bad?
Now why is that?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
What about you?
Nervous?
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Bri'.
...never?
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
...You know what I mean?
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
...Janitor's job.
What do you think?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
Well, how was it?
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Shit.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Did she suck your dick?
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Casper, where's Telly.
Casper, where is he?
Where you goin' tonight?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
What?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Uh huh.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
What do I want to do?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Sorry.
Are you in trouble with the law?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Yeah.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
I hate 'em.
No. I was just kidding.
So, how many people live here now?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
What are you talking about?
You still having a problem with this?
You alright?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
What is it?
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
A few people.
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
What's this?
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Nope.  Nothing.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
You might not have done it had you known.
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
Why did he?
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
Is your dad here?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Has he gotten through to any?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
You ready?
It isn't Kathy.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Same as the others?
Well?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
Then I'll transpose.
You're always in the middle of a match.
You have something you want to say?
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
Do you always open quickly?
What are you looking for?
We need your help.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
I'm not playing a game now.
What is this?
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
Nothing.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Because I know what it says.
You beat him.
It's over now.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
I'm not nervous.
We're almost married.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
You will go alone.
The new Queen lives.
I can't reach her.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
<u>Why</u>?
Never.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
How did you know?
Let me comfort you.
Once is enough, thank you.
Fame.
Go, join them.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
You!
What is that awful looking place?
You do?
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
We meant only to please you.
He didn't join them. They joined him.
He is the King.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Can you see?
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
Few have survived it.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
Who speaks that name!
She bore you many children?
Knowledge.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
...Office 2702.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Come on, get down!
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
...No...
How many girlfriends did you have?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
I don't know... Five minutes.
How shall we get out now, Leon?
How are you, Miss?
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
But... He works for your same employer?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
He probably just went somewhere.
Here comes the resume.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Nothing's going to happen.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
The new store?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
I do love you... very, very much.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Your father?
That's okay -- really it is.
Why there?
That's a reasonable assumption.
Red flags man.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
What happened?
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
I'm walking there Kris.
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
Tom Joad?
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
What do your friends call you?
How are you feeling?
What's your shoe size?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
Coffee?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Don't run away.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
Thank you. What time is it?
Yes.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Don't you like me, Ben?
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
I'm going to fill it right now.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
How are you doing?
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
I wanted to see you...
You know I love you... yeah?
A full night on the street and this is all?
Yes? What?
You understand you're on trial for murder?
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
How many, would you say?
Why the hell not?
What are you talking about?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Sit down.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
What did you see when you entered the house?
What's going on?
I'm sorry?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Yes?
Yes?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
You almost had me fooled.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Too demure?
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
Josh proposed!
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
She's not!
And you know this for a fact?
The what?
Okay, how would it work?
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
What the hell is that for?
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
So now you're -- ?
Someone missed you.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
And I fully support that.
I completely agree.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Well, yeah, but --
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Why?!
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
We go out, smash 'em now?
My generosity is not so large as that.
Your love.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Why have you brought me here?
No more... please...
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
You come stealee tleasoo?
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
But... but, why?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
Shhhh!
What is it?
Damn them!
Track the demon to his lair.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
I should hope not!
God's blessing.
Is she... dead?
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Wait, Jack.
Can we trust him?
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
Easily spoken...
Water doesn't burn...
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
One more turn...
Aye.  We're good as inside.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Sunlight.
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
You see!  You see!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
A gentleman would offer water.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Its powers are strong.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
No!  I won't let it happen...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Sigurd's sword...
What's this now?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Exceeding fair.
No!
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
Courage, Jack.
And charmed, of course.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
Please...
Where?
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Sorry, Jack.
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Uhm... fine work.
Is he a friend, then?
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Simple as that, eh?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
In a dream.
Dad's disappeared!
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
He's not there.
When does George get to come see his house?
What's that for?
He hasn't called?
Red.
Why?  What do you mean?
Atonement.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
Are you his friend?
Why?
You have to ask like that?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
You should stay.
I can't even take a shower here.
I wanted him to marry her.
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
What's the point of this?
Josh said...
I was wondering.
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
You hate your father.
You'd hate him for the trick.
Where are you?!
This is such a street of whiners.
Are you guys' friends?
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
That would take weeks.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Well, it's the least I can do.
I didn't recognize you!
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
Probably in the bible.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
You'll have money when you work.
I'm not doing it!
I don't beg.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Hi, Alyssa.
I took some of your Vicodin.
That's not true.
I know parts of who you are.
Sun glasses?
And you told Mom today?
I don't wanna go, Sam.
What would you do?
What kind of house?
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
He never answers.
What?
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
Four days.  I left to think.
I was parked in day parking.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Hey, hey!
I drove over and you were gone.
Last time you were gone for a week!
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I used to live here.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I'm married.
Let's not do this, okay?
Peter left me yesterday.
I could die.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
We've eaten.
To shave your chest?
I'm helping George build his house.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I can't go right now.
Despite you.
Do it now!
You don't look like you.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
You got a dog?
You're sure about this?
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Queer.
I brought a few of my own.
He's a big one.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
These are free papers.
No, but...
Yeah...
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
I got it... boss.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Don't I know you?
Sure I do. What's your name again?
What are they gonna do to us?
How would I get a loan, anyway?
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
What ain't there?
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
No.
Does that mean I'm in?
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
I know people.
You get ketchup?
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
You sure it was him?
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
You ever done time before?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
You got your own nightclub?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
I can't take that, mama.
Wait for the firemen!
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Lemonade?
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
What's your name?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
Is this a joke?
We could create our own hell there.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
No!
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
I'll call her later.
She goes to Parson's, right?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
I didn't murder anybody
This is baloney!
Now everybody sit down.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
You came through, Nicky.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Hey.
Thanks.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Look who's back from the dead.
Schnapps...
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
You got the wrong window again, man.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
The South.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
It's freezing my hands.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
No.
..."The Devil?"...
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Nicky!
Do me.
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
How do you think we got here??!!
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
That's better.  How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
How did they get in here?
What other food?
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
Who invited you?
Of course.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
About what?
I'm listening.
Please? What friends?
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Don't ever let go.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
...But I still have the choice...?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
Is it inside the city?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
What kind of jewel is this?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
What people?
I'll make the arrangements.
Come with us.
Goodbye.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
How long have you been living here?
Are there any other humans?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
Well? How do you like it?
Good... You up for a drive?
Pete... You okay?
I was here yesterday.
Can I call you?
Hello.
Hi.
Sure.
Pete?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
What's he do?
In pornos?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Set.
You all right?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Better.
Yeah.
Sheila?
Have you made any charges against him?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Who is it?
What is this, Rogoff?
No.
There's no other bedroom?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
At your house.
Who's it from?
When you didn't come to the club.
I called, you know.
Where would you feel safe?
I thought you were getting me a drink?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
I told you to stay in the car!
They're gonna cook him.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
At sixty?
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
Why haven't you called me?
You still care about me?
No... I told you.
Sheila?!
Where'd you come from?
Sheila...
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Two years!?
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Is it?
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Have I?
The police?
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
They were in a quandary, and—
Huh?
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
Oh, yes.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
108 and still active?
Very often.
I surprise you? Now that's news.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
What do you want?
No porters here!!
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
It's astonishing - and incredible, but—
Sondra Bizet.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
George, what are you going to do?
Yes.
What's it mean?
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
George, what do you think you're doing?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
I'd go mad!
Maria?
What's she got to do with it?
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Where were you hiding?
What do you suggest?
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
I'm so glad.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Ouch!
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
What is it?
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
...touch that.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
It'll make sense later?
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
What?
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
Jesus...
How does that help me?
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
So... how'd you hear about this?
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
What the hell does that mean?
Yeah ... ?
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Goodwill...
Did he say where?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
Which way?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
He's gone, too.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
They're gone.
And they're buying it?
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
Wally!
Take it.
No.  Follow him.
I can't.  I have to know.
Where are we going?
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
I put you away --
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
You the only sentry?
Tell me not to worry, John.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Red Ball?
Confirm with trig and image.
Why did you catch that?
You're certain?
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Really?  You've never been inside?
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
You set me up...
They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
She spoke to me.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
She's a precog?
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
I won!
Okay... now let me time you.
You're alive?
I forgive you.
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
But you have to.  They said you would.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Something wrong?
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
Heal who?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
This is all my fault.
Who?
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
You have an emergency call on your private line.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
So there is a way to fool the system?
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
He looks familiar.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
You know I need to use you.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Thank you, sir.
Is he cute?
He's great, right. Is he great?
I know.
Ricky's not wearing one.
You're not my daddy.
No.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Take her.
But what about them?
Get your hands off of her.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
Well, you look it. You win?
What's your record at?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
Yeah.
C'mon girl. Eat up.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
So what do we do?
Heard of them.
A million. Easy.
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
You want --
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
Spa?
'Trustafarians?'
Taken care of?
Can you check?
What about it?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
He implied it.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
It's ours.
Who you calling?
C'mon, man...
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
What exactly did they say?
Nothing else.
So they said more than the address.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
You know this guy?
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
So is this the drop?
Yeah.
What the hell did you do?
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
We're not getting whacked.
What are you doing.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Let's check out the penguins.
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Wanna bet?
Float me a hundred bucks.
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
What about it?
Calm down.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Kinda. Yeah.
Yeah. I want it.
Cardiff Giant?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
How much is what?
Yes.
Excuse me.
Where's Spa.
How do you know it's not drugs?
No shit?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Good morning.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Yeah.
I call 'em wiggers.
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Can I borrow a piece of --
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
Yeah.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Dip?
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Did you just now con me?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
Daddy, where's my money?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
The body is a holy repository.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
Do you?
I'll have it tomorrow.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
What points?
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
Let's talk about you for a change.
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Just what are you saying?
Let him finish.
Is she hooking?
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
I mean it's late, baby.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
How many you turning out?
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
Let me die then.
You evil this morning.
That ain't bad.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
They talked about me like
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[How does it work?]
[Who killed her? You?]
[Don't lie to me.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
Who's he?
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Yes. Many times.]
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
How long you staying, Crease?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
Creasy?
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
We're taking a different way home.
Did you like school, Creasy?
So you were unhappy?
You're fast.
What are you doing?
Do you think he'll come back?
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
You think too much?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Creasy... Wait.
Rosanna Guerrero.
Where are you?
[You have the money.]
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
He has to go, Samuel.
Creasy.
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[I know this. Your point?]
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
Hey, Herbie...
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
I'll call her up.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
Waddaya gonna do now?
Who you gonna call?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
Who told you that?
Ufa!
When was this?
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
Yeah.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Wadda you think?
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
I'm stag.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
Don't worry about it.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
So I'll die without a son.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Well...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Tommy!
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
What do you want me to do?
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
You – must – open – me – up – again?
So long, Ho-Jon.
Us. Lead us not into...
What?
You got directions?
Well, there it is. Jesus!
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
When will he be able to write?
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
Any time. Whenever we want.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
I think I heard about that.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Is he out?
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
All of them?
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
They missed the boat.
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
What's the story?
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
You don't aim to cause any trouble – But?
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
O'Reilly!
Sir?
Sir?
Sir?
Good morning, Colonel.
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Yeah?
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
Did you get it, too?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Ted Sheldon.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
How much money do you get?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Hello?
That's good.
Who, for instance?
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
Hello! . . . Yeh?
Hey, Boss.
Help yourself.
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
Grubbel's here. See? 
You don't have to—Why, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
No!
It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
I trust him.
Well, I don't get it.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
How about family? Got any family?
It's for Ann . . .
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
What do you mean, too bad?
Racket? What do you mean?
Have you got the speech I gave you?
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
No -- you can't do that.
Floor seats.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
Where's the stereo?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Could I please have a little water?
Don't make do it, Mike.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
Manual or automatic?
You signed out twice.
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
Hi, Roper.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
You don't have to come here.
Open your shirt.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
How do you feel after a shooting.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
Recruited you from where?
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
You got a girlfriend?
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
What's the first commandment?
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
The 6 horse is last.
The 6 horse is still last.
We won!
What the fuck is going on.
How many have you lost?
And what about the ones you don't save?
And what if you can't live with it?
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
McCall, you all right?
Is the hostage injured?
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
When?
How's Paco doing?
There is?
Yeah?
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Stay here, don't move.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
You crazy? With all those people around?
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
What do we got?
What do you want?
There are two million people in there with you.
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
She said I have a son...
How come I can't remember?
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
Do you believe in miracles?
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
You are not a God.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
And what about the reconfiguration?
But what if he doesn't --
How long?
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
Where you plugged-in from?
The woman you're stuck on.
Take care.
Two maze runners.
You're jumping to conclusions.
One condition.
What is it?
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
Then you had her killed.
Need the disk back!
What brings you inside?
Someone you have to get back to?
You went to my high-school?
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
I wasn't with you.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Don't know what you're talking about.
Voice activate.
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Program name?
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
We've got him locked!
Wow.  Sand.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
... What's happening to him?'
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
Release the power with the power.
Anybody see anything?
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
PTERODACTYL!
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
Let's go after him!!
I'm in!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
There goes the neighborhood.
... A falcon?
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
Just shut your gap!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
What is THAT!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
You own a hotel, sir?
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
We're asking you to go to prison.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
The goddamned bastards.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
When my money moves, I go with it.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
What's the matter?
Something came up.
Same here.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
I booked passage to London.
Charlie!
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Like Don Maranzano.
I'll handle the Boss.
You're getting' 10 cc's
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
I like that.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
What are ya thinkin'?
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Not stupid. Fat.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
He's an animal!
You get fifteen percent.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
We must be friends, Charlie.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
What's the matter?
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
Bitchin' good cake.
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Stu...LOOK!
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
What about the fellow in those pictures?
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Mother!
What happened?
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
He's an organic farmer.
Where to?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Positively not in the station! Gone!
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Tell me why!
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
You play--left field.
Did you like the first act?
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Okay. You don't mind?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Diz!
That infernal phone!
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
All right, why?
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Mr. President!
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Ah, now, that's better.
It does!
Mr. President! A point of order!
Please, sir!--come with me!
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
What is it?
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Good. Where are we?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Pardon?
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
I did--and--and I got right up.
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
I've got more. You better tell me.
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Hello.
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
Sure.
Oh--you are!
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Order, gentlemen!
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Nice *compliment*!
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
Why don't you do it yourself?
Well--me, too!
What are you talking about? What difference--?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
You won't stand for it?
How nice.
Will the Senator yield?
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Any children?
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Ready?
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
The guy's balmy.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
How'd you get the picture?
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Come on, John. What happened?
Miss Bennett please!
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You're going to New York with us.
Yes. That is to say—
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Why not? Who is he?
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
Now, where were we?
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Yes, sir.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Your Honor—
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
A what?
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
You came home last night - without them.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Me, sir?
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
Dr. Mumford.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
But you do therapy?
What an asshole!
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
I see.
What?
Where's your wife, Henry?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
That's a lot of people all at once.
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
And the Brocketts?
...so rich?
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Hello, Lionel.
Got a license?  But no car?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
What's wrong with her?
Hiya, Doc.
I think you do.
Wow. You're something.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
What can you tell me about this?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Even if you don't think it's real?
What would you do?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Mom's such a cutie.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
You're doing great.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Mother...
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
What did he want you to do?
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
I've got three big ones.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
She's probably ten years older than you.
Well, there's Lily.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Damn! What is your name?
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
"Get to know your therapist."
And the drugs?
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
You know where he's taking her?
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
Immune from what?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
Yeah?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
The key!? She has the lost key!?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
The sun turning black.
And what is he in prison for?
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
You lie.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
You two!
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
Is he supposed to look like that?
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
Got guts, lady.
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
Jonathan?
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
Hey,... don't I know you?
Where's my gun?
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
It must have slipped my mind.
Where are you going?
I thought you were done?
You two timing psychotic bastard.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
He was the last time I saw him.
Come on, baby!
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Yes!
Snap out of it!
Have you considered my offer?
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Hi.
I admire you.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
I'm going inside.
You're the Sphinx.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
I'm liking this.
There's just not enough of us.
The who?
Sounds good.
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
Roy --
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Are you famous?
Jeffrey!
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
This is bad.
Be a Mohican.
Do we have to?
To us!
That was too close.
We've got lift off!
Where am I going?
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Proceed.
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
I don't know, sire.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
General Bonaparte?
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
I haven't been there for three years.
Why didn't you wake me then?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Oh...?
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Good evening, sir.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
What's your name?
Only Lisette?
I know of no better time.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
When is she supposed to return?
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Were you in love with any of them?
She must have been in love with you.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Go away -- I'm busy.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Who is it?
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
And, where did you see my portrait?
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Who are you?
No I'm not.
Great moves, Day-Day.
Naw, I already ate.
It's about to work, just come on.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
What's crackin'?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
Who is that?
You know what this is?
How can they do this?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
You better stop running from that girl.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
You see that?
Yeah, air.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
I will.  When can I come visit?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
You alright?
What is it?
Craig, remember what I told you.
You too.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
What was that?
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Get 'em, Craig!
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Where's Craig?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Tape his mouth shut.
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
'S okay. What do you think?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
How do you know that?
You shot her?
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Could I see some identification, sir?
You're out of your mind.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
You get another chance in ten minutes.
You killed him.
I killed you.
I kill her - and you kill me.
How am I supposed to get away?
One thirty. California Ballroom.
Are you sure?
But...
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
We have to hurry.
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
Can we go now?
Will you promise me that?
All right. Kisses to you.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Cover your mouth.
Oh, Jesus ...
Then why'd you drag me into it?
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Meet Irene.
Well?
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
You have, huh?
I'm not a baby.
I've got something for you.
You got this under control?
Get moving.
He never told about the money.
What do you figure he done with it?
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Where's Ruby?
AAA-MENN!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
Pearl dotes on him.
Amen! Amen!
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Why?
Tell me a story, John.
John...
It's all here.
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Where are we goin', John?
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Don't you hurt her!
Story, honey? Why, what story?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
All right boy: where's the money?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Now it's your turn.
Sure, that's no secret.
O no! Your turn!
What's their names?
Mister Powell?
The first night?
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
What are you after them for?
He never asked me for nothin'.
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
How can you tell?
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
What the hell's going on!?
You okay?
Guess I did.
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
You believe in anything?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
What happens if they don't do that?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
She dreamed this would happen...
Decide to take a day off after all?
Hello Nancy.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Did you sleep?
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
What's with the bars?
Guess I should'n'a done it.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
And then what happened?
What you mean 'all at once'?
Rod says the sweetest things.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Well, here are fifty francs.
Bring me forty-five back.
Good evening, Anna.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Capitalistic methods...
That must be the one!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
We can wait.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
If you want to see us you must come later.
What proposition?
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
We may have a chance.
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
Business.
Private.
I must get into that country of yours!
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Suppress it.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
What do we do now?
And what do you do for mankind?
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
Don't do it, please.
Room service speaking.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Will you smile?
Just smile.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
On which boat?
No... go on.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
How do you do?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Comrades! Comrades!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No speech.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
Is this the wish of the masses?
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Hello, Leon!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
Well... that's my business, madame.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
At Père Mathieu's.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
Executive clemency ...
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Where's Hunt now?
Why not?
We can't touch Hoover --
No, you didn't, Bob.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
About a dozen.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
I can't ...
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
Mom expects great things from you ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
No.
You'll win the nomination.
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
Who do you think is behind it?
How the fuck did you know?
Who we working for?
Where'd you find him?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
How about Kissinger along with him?
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
... Use his women.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Where you from?
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
We got the press this time!
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
You're not a failure, Dick.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Dick, don't...
You don't have to go.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
This.  Above all.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
Won or lost?
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Some say you are, Rocky.
How many a those things you got now?
Want a cup?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
Yes.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
He's real all right.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Yes ma'am?
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
We goin' in?
...Now that's aggravating.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
Wasn't no bullet?
How's that, Sheriff?
Yessir.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
I thought it was a car afire.
...Be careful.
Don't get hurt.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I got it Mama.
I put it in, Mama.
No.
You gave your word?
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
So... for how long do we have to...
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Llewelyn?
I know where the money is.
What's that.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Where does he work?
Huh? What is...
Airport.
...I know where you are.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
How much?
Didn't mean nothin'.
Will there be anything else?
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
What kind of tent?
One room, one night.
You on all night?
What do you want to know?
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
That's me.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
It's called a transponder.
...What do you do?
Pot metal?
The heroin. You don't have it.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
Are you jackin' with me?
What outfit.
How is she?
Could I have that in American?
Sheriff, I don't...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Junior year!
Oww, the arm, the arm!
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
Great. Good. Content...
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
No... what about your sister?
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
I beg your pardon?
That's very kind of you.
Oh, you mean Fred.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
You never gave us a chance...
Why do they keep calling you George?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
Of course.
I don't think your friend likes me.
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
So, call me when you --
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
...like the water purifiers?
Yes.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
How did you know?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
It's something I had to do. For David.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Guess who I saw today.
Looking for someone?
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Are you sure I can borrow this?
You should have a little faith in people.
What are you doing?
...this is your sweater, right?
Your husband?!
What?! That you had something to do with it?
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Now, that's really stupid.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
Joyce was screwing Del.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
How'd they describe her?
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
I'm not telling.
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Really?
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
Hang on there -
It ain't the law!
...Pete?
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
Izzat right?
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Helluva idea.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
That's not my ring.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
An' all my meals for free...
It was a moment a weakness!
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Fact of the matter - there never was!
Pete... I do apologize.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
It was a powerful air.
Daddy!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
That's a maiden name.
Come back here, kid!
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Great ass.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
What's your name, boy?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I want your D.O.R.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
What did you call me?
Yes I do!
How late?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
What other issue is there, Sid?
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
That was you guys, huh?
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
God help you, Lynette!
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Do you go to school?
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I vote for the motel.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
Want me to get a towel?
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
What's the matter?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
I'm looking for Sid.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
Hey, you guys still awake?
That isn't true, is it?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
What? You've gotta be kidding!
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
What the fuck is funny about this?
Me.  I am.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Yes.
Th --
Are you okay?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
She's gonna handle it.
They're not supposed to be here!
Asshole.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
They're coughing.
She's never coming out.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
'Bout four o'clock.
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
You don't look so good.
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
That door is a safely hazard.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Makes me nervous.
No, Edgar Allen.
He's going down.
Can't hear a thing.
What if they get in here?
"What we want is in that room."
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
What are you doing?
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Tyrone...
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Those ain't cops.
What are you doing with the gun?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
Inspector Brimmer
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
You got it. Berkeley?
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Now hold on Rodgers...
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Yes sir, I did.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
We're working on that...
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
That's right brother... listen and learn.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
You were. infantry right?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
I saw... but...
Yeah, I do.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
This cool the heat off you any?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Ain't no one seen him.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
When?
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
You got salt last week.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Very well, let us move on to...
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
If I fail, you fail.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
What news?
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
You don't hate him.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
You were an Englishman then...
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
One of yours?
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
Where is he now?
Who's in command?
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
It is ended.
How far away?
Thank you.
How many came back?
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
No-I guess not.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
I don't get it.
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Hey--they actually found the place!
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
Going to tell Ellie?
What are those for?
But--
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
Leave me alone!
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
The situation has changed.
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
You have a name, missy?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
The curse drove you to gather this?
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
I know the code.
You're in league with Barbossa!
Come on!
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
That was before I met one, of course.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Say again?
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Raise the sails.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
You cheated.
Move!
Because you're a pirate.
Come aboard.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
Just do it quickly.
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
No, it's not.
He's still breathing.
Commodore --
But --
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
Oh no?  Smell this.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Do you think she loves him?
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
Well, you got another problem.
What are you going to do?
You were never invited to my house.
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Yeah.
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
We don't have time for hysterics.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
That was an egg?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Look at this!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Do you have something to bring me down?
Did you go?
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
You're not going after Argon!
God, what a fight that was.
Things do change.
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
That's impossible.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Where did you get those letters?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Oh, Mother!
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
A little—? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
What's the idea, Anne?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
What is this person doing here?
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Ah-ah-ah!
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
This way.
I knew your managing editor very well.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Thank you very much.
What do you want?
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Yeah.
Come on, get going, get going!
Why not?
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
How do you like your bath, sir?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
You what?
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
My error.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
How far have you gotten?
Did who?
Here you are.
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
What did he want?
What other girl—?
No.
Thanks. May I sit down?
Yes.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand—and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Yes - the worm!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Oh no ... I'm fine.
Thank you.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Like a drum.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
Oh.  I can't.
Don't! Just let go.
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
I don't believe it.
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
But it could happen.
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
What do you mean!?
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
God, David. Just give it to me!
Oh God.
Who's that?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
What did you do to him?
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Yeah ...
No. She really liked you.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
You got the admissions letter.
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
What do we do?
Can I open it?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
... Like Prince Charming.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
How much does it cost?
Hello there.
What?
Look ...
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
EXCUSE ME?
OW!
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
How long do you think you've been here?
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
You know what I really like?
What's wrong?
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Free?
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
...yes I'm still on hold...
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
What city?
What's the listing?
Hello.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Please don't.
...please, I just don't want it....
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
You look nervous.
Why?
It's not cool?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
Goodbye.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Hello, this is Back.
Nothing.
Where are you?
It doesn't matter.
No.
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Hi....what....what's up....?
I'm going to work.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
It was cool last night.
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
There's a piano in the street.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Hi.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Oh My God.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Who is it?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
No I didn't say that.
What happened?
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Have a good trip.
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
How many times have you been on an airplane?
That's right you travel so much.
I forgot about that.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
Ok.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
No.
I don't know.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
You want her to call you Jack?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Now are you threatening me, dick?
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, good morning, Barry.
Good morning, Barry....
What happened?
....now: this pudding?
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
Yes.
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Yes I am.
Nothing.
I know.
I don't really remember that.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
So they'll go.
Hello?
Yeah.
We should be going --
So...did my brother call you?
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
There I was taxed; it's true.
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
What the devil --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
-- water! --
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
NEVER!
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
Oh. That.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
It was fiction, of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
I'll do everything in my power --
He'll do no such thing.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
How is the patient faring?
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
I'll be waiting.
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
A kiss for each page.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
-- words alone are insufficient.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
Leave at once --
Doesn't that please you?
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
What are movies about?
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
Sigmund Freud?
The great Spanish bullfighter
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
This better be good
It doesn't have to be
He'll destroy us.
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
Did I ever tell you about my father?
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
Hedy Lamarr?
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
You gonna watch?
Mank!
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Oh God.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
It came.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
They wanna talk to you.
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Hey champ!
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
Where you going at this hour?
J.R., glad you could make it.
You're a good sport, lady.
What's wrong?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Answer me when I talk to you.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Who's that?
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
You want us to wait for you?
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
See? That's all there was to it.
Except fall down like a normal person.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
How's that?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
I can't find my ball.
Now take the rest off.
Huh?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Jake, no --
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
What are you doing?
But they don't have a case against you.
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
How's the weight? Ok?
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
This is Doyle's house.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
His wife took a trip.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
I'll send you some comic books.
Hello.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Hello.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I knew it!
That's abnormal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
He and his wife splitting up?
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
Huh?
Mrs. Thorwald?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
No.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
What do you need money for?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
Hello.
Yes.
Not yet, Jeff.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Who's Thorwald?
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
What a day I've had!
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
We have all -- what?
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Do you like it?
Wasn't that close?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
Meaning me?
Just him.
What you say your name was?
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
What's he going to pull--
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
No.
Tell him why we moved here.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
You awake?
We don't have time.
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Excuse us a minute?
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Are you going down there?
Frank!
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
He has a knife.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Isn't it crazy?
Let's see how long we can stay under.
Isn't he schizoid?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
I don't want you for my father!
That's swell.  How are you?
No.
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
I shot at one of them.
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Get lost.
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Okay--
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
Goodbye!  See you!
No--I was just--maybe--
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Oh, Jim!
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
After he tried to shoot you?
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Plato, where's your father now?
Do you think your father means that?
Didn't you forget something?
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
A man of some travels.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
He wants... your "sister"...
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Toys for... adults?
We sell children's toys --
No --
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
NO!
You sold him out.
No, Nick, no --
Your pen palls dead, lady.
Nick died for me....
Gabriel!
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
So does it look a lot different?
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
I love you, Nick...
He wants to see your map.
No.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
No --
No, you can't --
Who are you now.
You what...
So you could get with my sister.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What?
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
No way.
You gotta be kidding me.
Ash?
Where the HELL did he go?
...so where is he?
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
The Powwow Safe?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
You want that for here or to go?
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
What about the money?
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Hot chocolate.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
She's using a new perfume.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Don't move, Rudy!
Jesus, Rudy --
NO!!!
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
That was my king!
POP! That was My card!
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
We can work this out, can't we?
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
What's this?
I can do that.
Tell me more about Cabot.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Jesus Christ!
Mr. Brown?
Myself and Mr. Pink?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
What for?
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Follow you where?
For what, the cops?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
I'm cool.
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
No shit?
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
It doesn't matter who they are.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
And this is Helen Carter.
But you eat, don't you?
They're stragglin'.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
I -- lost something.
Who's Lednov?
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
At the ranch maybe?
Where'd they go?
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
You know what she asked me?
Half of them are mine.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
It isn't that --
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
Stop it -- stop it.
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
What's the matter -- restless?
Even women?
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
We don't want to go there.
Go on. Have another try at him.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
How far up the trail?
We got to get movin'.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Gee, I can't.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
What do they look like?
Well, Steve?
She was only teasin'.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Are you okay?
That's it.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Cindy, what's going on?
Hello Brenda.
So, I guess I can go now.
Maybe we can study together or something.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Where the hell are we?
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Feel that?
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Let her go, Cin.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
I'm Cindy.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
What the hell are you doing?
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
I take it you're not mad at me.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
I finished all the interviews.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
Professor, I think you should see this.
The image there.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Father.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
I woke up naked, too.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Hi!
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Because it's the rules!
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Chip, your ride is here.
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
Don't wake the kids...
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
Objection! Argumentative!
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
And who may I ask is Carl?
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
It's him!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
You got your wish.
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
Certainly not!
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Man, that one made me puke!
I'll give you fifty cents.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
I'll give you a check.
I haven't got that much in cash.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -— had your picture in her office.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
Redi's all right.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What were you talking about?
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you -— you know that?
What's that?
Who are you?
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
I don't know.
You'll be all right?
Were you going to make a suggestion?
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I have been at the library.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
My window - - through which I see the world.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe—laces; now this sudden humility.
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
Yes. When I tell you.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it —— your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
That makes it all the more difficult ——
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
I don't know.
You are?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Are you in the middle of something?
What are these?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
To you?
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
That's a good question.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Do you talk to him?
Is he going to see this?
So you do fantasize?
About me?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
On tape?
Yes.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
I can't.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Like maybe a big part?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Because.
Why are you ashamed?
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
Something wrong?
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
Where did you go when you left here?
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
What do you mean, like physically?
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Questions about sex.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Because I wanted to.
I wanted him to see me.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
It's a sun dress.
Thank you.
I get real busy between two and four.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Would anybody else see the tape?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
Do you want me to stop calling?
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Hung up.
No.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
What tapes?
IBM.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Another kiss?
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
But where are you going?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Yes?
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY

Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
When do I get to see Brad?
But...how?
SIN-I-FUL
How did you come by this scenario?
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
SPONSOR!!!
We're the experts.
A free thinker.
McKinley?...McKinley?
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?

Could I do that later?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Oh my poor baby.
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME
Brad!
Our field.
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
That's an extremely negative response.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
WHAT A JOKE...
THAT MINIMAL
CRIMINAL
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
She walks in beauty...
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
So what's up?
Why are you being so defensive?
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
Glass or bottle?
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Two years ago, buddy.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
What happened to you guys?
Are you a writer too?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
She what?  When?
What do you think?
So what should I wear?
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Later.
Oh, boy.
You should call her.
Hey, there you are.
Where is Stephanie?
Does she know about Saturday?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
I said okay?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
Do you like them?
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Let me use your phone.
What's that supposed to mean?
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
What's wrong?
What the fuck!
Look at this!
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
Are you all right?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Ken.
That's great.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
How much skin and stem contact?
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
So what are you up to today, Miles?
What are you thinking about?
No.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
I don't want you to die.
Hi sweetie.
You do?
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
I'm not going to curse.
Do you think it's a possibility?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
We won't be able to get out of there.
Merrill --
I can feel air.
No.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
That's good enough for me.
It needs batteries.
I'm getting out now.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
I can't even imagine.
What about them?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
Is anything missing?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Is that him?
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
McKendrick's men got him.
Gotta go.
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
It's not going to be easy.
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
You might make a farmer yet.
That's a lie.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Where's your brother?
Who is he?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What are you talking about?
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
What's all this then?
Hello, Rae.
He was murdered.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
You got a place to stay?
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
You really are a gambler.
I've got a place I can hide her.
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Why isn't she with you?
I can't wait to meet her.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
She doesn't want pity.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
My two favorite girls.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Mom, do you miss Dad?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
What?... What did you say?
No, I'm okay.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
There's... a wall between you --
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
-- Flesh is weak.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
"Straw God" changed my life.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
Hi, Dad.
She still with Kent?
Me too.
You know, I... don't know.
Okay, Dad.
You know me -- married to my work.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
Do I know you?
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Is it a jamming device?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
It's a hotel.
Thank you.  It's not important.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Hi.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
You mean they buy it?
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
You did create me.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
Don't step in the horse manure.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
Where should I look then, Cole?
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
What'd you write?
...No.
Don't cry.
I wish I were somewhere else.
Don't go home, okay?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Communicate?
You know that accident up there?
Where is she?
You see ghosts, Cole?
Yes, Cole?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Get off his case sweetie.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Suzie???
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Come on --
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
"Peggy-Sue" --
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
What about Jeremiah?
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
You wouldn't understand.
No --
Get out of here.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p-please...
I almost thought for a second...
What is it?!!
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
Second verse!
Carl.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
Shit.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
How are you going to find him?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Pretty, ain't they?
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
No reception out here.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
What?
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Looks like a chipmunk.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Who's the lucky fella?
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Sure thing, killer.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Welcome home.
I'll get if for you.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Where'd he go?
Get your hands off my daughter!
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
You got my barley pop?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Kate McConnell.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Who'd want to?
Anything?
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
I'm proud of you.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
What can I say?
He's just exhausted.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
See ya, Bandit.
But you'll do it?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Or in the slammer.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Liquid gold.
You know how to drive one of these things?
You can't swear on these.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
Bandit?
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
We're outta motion lotion.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
-- How we doing?
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Have any trouble getting here?
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
You're sure?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
...I forgive you Darwin.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
What happened?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
That's probably him now...
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
It's the last place they'd look.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
... Jesus... what for?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
So how we lookin'?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
I'm working on it.
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
For real?
True?
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
What's wrong?
Gibarian.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Listen --
No.  There's no behavior modification.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Probably.
Kelvin, you awake?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
What plan?
Jesus...
Rheya...
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
What do you remember?
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Is it a planet?
Then it's God, right?
You still don't believe in God?
What happened?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
He has a point.
Why did she do it?
Was she right?
You're the coward.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
But that's what happened before.
Do you want to stay here?
You said he was dead.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
What does it want?
Gibarian was under enormous --
Snow, get up here, now.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Hi.
Uh...
Put it on my account, please.
You all right?
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
No dog.
What about Neil?
You asked.
You put me life in danger.
Yeah.
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Are you okay?
"For"...?
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Keep what handy?
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
So how'd it go?
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
Hey.  The neighbors.
Bought it.
Coming to bed?
What?
What was that?
Let me drive...
Ellie...
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
Wasn't your fault.
I asked for the man in charge...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
No, I will not step outside.
You're here 'til what time?
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Under the table.
What're we having?
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's what?
Well, look who's dressing for success.
And Flash isn't?
Here you go, Pete.
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Jesus Christ.
You get mugged or something?
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Can't focus...
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Some prep school thing.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
You'd feel what?
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
You sure about all this?
Yeah, Roz.
I'll introduce you.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
Mr. Parker.
Where'd you get the clown suit?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Let's blow, Chauncey.
105-353.
I'll live.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
Jawohl.
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
No, Animal.
You'll fix me up!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Betty! Betty!
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
What about Schulz?
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
We've all done a poor job of it.
Why the south latrine?
What radio?
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Who did?
What are we going to do with him?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
The what?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
You heard him.
Where is he now?
Captain=8A
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Are any of them inhabited?
Is she still angry?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Well?
I get it. I get it.
What?
Data, this isn't the time.
Can you locate them?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
The Nexus.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
Did your collaborator know?
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Captain, what's happening?!
What's wrong?
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Wait! Give me a chance --
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
Give me your hand and we both live.
Yes, I was...
He asked you not to grieve...
What must I do?
What about Spock?
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
You're not going in there -- !
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Shore leave, Admiral.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
... taking Genesis away from us...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Don't tell me you've got something.
But the child --
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
Well done, Commander.
It's the Genesis Wave!
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
I didn't expect anything.
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
Let go -- he can't -- !
What are you looking at?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
They won't --
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Uhura. Can't you augment?
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Gentlemen, this isn't --
What's she doing here?
They knew just where to hit us.
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Not enough against their shields.
Affirmative, Admiral.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Kirk here.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
That was a little joke.
Yes.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
On screen...
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Indeterminate life signs.
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
That was close --
Time!
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
I really must thank you.
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Fire all phasers...!
He's very human.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
You lied.
The question is irrelevant.
I would accept that as an axiom.
Humans make illogical decisions...
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
It doesn't look all that different.
What did you say she was getting?
An experimental device, doctor.
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Can you isolate the wave?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Status report, Admiral!
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
We don't want to be any trouble.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
Do you trust me?
You're upset about losing the whales.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Wanna try it from the top?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Here... In the park?
It's true... what you said...
... Gone?!
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
The late 20th Century.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
What is it?
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Any luck...?
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Admiral! There be whales here!
The whales...?!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
With pleasure.
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
You have warp capability?
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
Will it?
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
No... I want to stay with you...
Won't he rust?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Will he live?
She's stabilizing.
Incomplete, I might add.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
You're not going to launch anything until...
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
I don't believe it happened that way.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Deck five.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
Worf to Picard...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Scanners are off line!
... Population three hundred million...
Why would we be involved with these people?
You haven't done that in a long time...
What you're doing to my neck...
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
You actually performed surgery...?
How long has he been unconscious?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
Do you know what this is, Data?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Can you configure it?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
What year is it?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Captain --
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
Main bus...
Yes.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Captain?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
Someone...?
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Spock, that was actually funny.
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
My God, what happened here?
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
And what did they tell you?
You were demoted...
For insubordination.
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Where IS the conference?
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
And your coat.
How did you know...?
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Aft thrusters -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
I hope you're happy.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
Surely not.
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
Never been this close.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Gorkon's own man??
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
A lie?
If you are logical.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
A computer canna lie, sir.
That could take hours!
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Fuzzy face is gone.
Do you know who I am?
Do you know where you are?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. I must deactivate you.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
Data!
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
What is our approximate distance?
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
How can you be certain?
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Deanna, on my mark.
How long until he can fire?
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I’ll snap its ugly head off.
That's your life... not mine.
It’s too late.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
My God...
This is a mistake.
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Benny, God, take it easy...
Right in line with that burning tree.
Gate three. It's boarding now.
What can I do for you folks?
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
What do you think of America?
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Where did you stop last?
Where's that?
It's real, George.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
That's the chance we have to take.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
What?
Which way?
Shit.
What?
What is...  ...Coke?
What's the matter?
I will see it next time.
Yes.
No... The closest...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
Jennyhaydn.
You thought we were a different planet?!
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
The captain...
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
It's bad.
I am not a good singer.
You liked my singing?
You can have one.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
What?
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
What will you say about us?
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
Where do you think you're going?
Tell the baby about me.
Slow down, slow down.
They after you?
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Is it for real?
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
No, sir. Radar.
I don't understand.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Bullshit politics.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
I made my choice, Lenny.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
You think Tran killed her?
I understand.  No, I'm not.
No.
Sounds good.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
So've I.  Too much.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
How did you hook up with Faith?
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
Commissioner Strickland.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
That would be no.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
How's Zander?
Whatup Lenny?
Shit!
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
I've got a good idea, yeah.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Right.  That explains it.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Was this him?
Besides that.
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
You tell me.
Hey, Sheriff.
Hi there.
You have the body?
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
I have 6 tons.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
He said it was a clue?
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
I'll take it into consideration.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
Why did you go to Chicago?
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
You work with Koessler?
This is a sexy case.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
You mean --
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Then there's the other issue.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
How's the arm?
So you went underground?
I don't carry it with me.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Was it Zero?
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I've been to Chicago.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Koessler?
"MyDick?"
How far is Amarillo?
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
You've been through worse.
You should call your Grandmother.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Like the quiche?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
You too?
Like what?
What else?
To do what?
...not until you book it...
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Why not?
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
I'll be around.
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
Good.  I think about things.
I miss you, Mike.
Unless she comes back first.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
Darwinism at its best.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
You haven't been drinking, have you?
I'm such an asshole.
What's dumb about it?
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
Pause it. 
She was cute.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
You live in such a fantasy world...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Mike?
Don't call me ever again.
Are you ready to order?
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
VEGAS.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Vegas, baby!
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Double down.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
You gotta do it.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
That's bullshit.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
Baby, you did fine.
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
What was the part?
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Sorry about interrupting...
That was different.
Don't remind me.
Selling scrap metal.
You guys are such assholes.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
We got the digits, baby.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
What the fuck..?
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...You're just poking at it...
You dick.
It's on.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
...Okay, two...
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
What do you wish me to do?
Eat it, it's on the table.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
No.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
And this?
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
Don Tommassino.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Is the hospital covered?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Will you give this letter to Michael.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
I'm German-Irish.
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
You really want to know?
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
What will your father say?
Hello.  Kay?
I can't...
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Will you?
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
How can you be sure?
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Uncanny!
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
You know, a primer.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
You like jazz!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
Good afternoon!
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
I know. I write like a child.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Do you have any brothers?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Ha.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
What about Christmas?
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
What?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
So you found Peter...
What's your secret?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
You're kidding.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Ditto.
We'll be there.
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Well, we're all working tonight.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Why?
I don't know...
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
Really?
That's really something.
Huh?
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
What hours do you work?
What are you doing?
Damn.
Where are you going?
Huh?
What about the record?
Hello, Travis.
Oh, Tom, please.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
No, why?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
No, why?
He's Black, OK?
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Where.
20 bucks?
Yeah. From the likes of them.
What's your real name?
No.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Well, you want to or not?
God, you are square.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
You a narc?
How?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
No.
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
There's porno theatres for that.
No.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Well, I just, you know...
Real down.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
Could we change the subject?
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Maybe.  Not really.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
You knew?  All this time?
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Dad?
How'd it go?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Do you... remember me?
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
What was that?
Do you have the...
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
When did you start smoking?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Delly, shhhhhh...
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Yes it does.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
No wallet, huh?
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
Wait'll you see the inside!
Why?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
A few.
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Here, one of mine.
Evening, Luke.
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Exactly.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
That was beautiful.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
Please, sit.
What happened?
That you got let go.
You mean, he was... let go, too?
You hungry, son?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
How do you like our little hamlet?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Then what was it?
Then why did she object to you?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
I see.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
They haven't harmed anyone.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Mitch, let's turn back.
Good morning.
Do you know him?
Where does he live?
See where I'm pointing?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Thank you.
How much for the phone calls?
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
Oh. I see.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
Tell him about the party.
When do you think they'll come?
Where will we go?
Mother, get a rope!
We won't be here.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
I couldn't ask you to.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Sixty...  Oh.
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
I don't know you.
When?
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
You like me, huh?
What did it say?
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Right next to the one you already had.
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Yes, but...
With... with Annie, of course.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
I'm sure.
Will I be seeing you again?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
What did it say?
I'd still like to see you.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
It's so damn quiet out there.
The town looks clear.
How long have they been gathering there?
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Do you want to try your father again? 
Where are they heading?
When will they stop?
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
We need them.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
I'm only a student.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
I don't think I can go on, sir.
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
We can't be sure of that.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
What do you mean, Fettes?
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
Are you a doctor, too?
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
Toddy hates me.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
But what makes a thought start?
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
I would make you rich.
What did you hear?
Can anyone hear what we say?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You're not going to Gray.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
Fucking Zombie.
The scar. Which of you has it?
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
Erin. Who?
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Just don't believe everything you see.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Why are there so many?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Are you ok?
What is it?
I think I dropped an earring.
They killed her because she found out.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Tell me what?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
No -- I'm afraid not.
No foolin'? Will you?
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
We certainly did.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs -– heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
I don't believe it.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
I wonder if we ought to--
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
How do you know?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
What is it you want?
You sure about that?
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
Just passing through Santa Carla?
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
They're gaining on us!
I can't beat a Triumph.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
What is this, David?
Where you going?
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
He's not glowing.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
Oh, no...
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Ouch, my hair...
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
-- a job.
Not impressed, are you?
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Let's go see them.
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Why not?
This room is mine.
You're beautiful.
Do I have to do this?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Michael?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
Who are you calling?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
What?
What?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
Childs!  That a fuse?
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Where's the other half?
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
I guess you're okay.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Put that down!
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Four!
What's...
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Where were the flashlights?
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
Where was he trying to go?
What's happened?!
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
He's one of them.
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
You know of them?
Do you know where they live?
Send him away.
Yes...
So, do we go on?
It's what they want you to see.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
Why would you let me go back?
Why?
So you take their best...
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
I'm tired of running.
It's spectacular...
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
Admiration?  My my.
Let's walk through the park...
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Where's the challenge in that?
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
That's absurd --
You won't say that in a week.
Good night, David.
Yes.
How long ago?
Why?
Don't then have stars where you come from?
The mud carriers.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Alexander...?
This is where my journey started... right here.
Kalen...
Mara -- what -- ?!
It was different then.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
My father has gone to a better place.
What do you mean?!
You know that's not true.
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
He's recovering on the third floor.
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
And what's that?
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
Who are you?
[Beat] You're his son?
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
How did you come to know their names?
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Your mom take anything before this happened?
I think I can remember what's on them.
I looked it up.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Why?
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
Why, what would you do?
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
Exactly.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
I tried to kill my wife.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
I'm not sure.
Well, how'd you get here?
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
Hon?
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
On what?
Who do you think did it?
We're both fine.
What kind of gun was it?
Good God.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
Louise, is that you?
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Is that how you answer the phone?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Is this your car?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
I'm cash poor.
What do you mean?
You're not touchin' that car.
Will I be?
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
So what are you gonna tell him?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Thelma.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Whaddo we do?
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
What?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
Thelma, that is not an option.
Me too.  I feel awake.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
Shit!
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
God!  It looks like the Army!
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop it!
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I don't know about this, Dom.
His mother?
What's so funny?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Shoot.
You know, clean the pipes.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Mary.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Healy you dog!
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Nineteen months I been sober.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
I know he's around here someplace.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
How about -- ?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Lint?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Fuck!!
All set.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
Jai alai?
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
I see where you're going.
I'd go with the seven.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
I can live with those reflections.
Have you been up all night again?
Meaning?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
What's up, Doc?
Oh yeah. Fine.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
What what are you doing here?
But but what about Steve?
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Eh.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
How are you doing, Warren?
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
Starshells.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Slow down. Smell that?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
How long until the army is ready?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
What's happened?
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
How's my favorite President?
I want an hour with him.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Secretary of Defense...
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
I was eating that.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
I see.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
Who is he?
What'd she say?
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Tread matches. It's the car.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
That's not solid.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Not no more.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
What's that?
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
You're the Indian FBI.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
Who did?
Ray...
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
You ever try solitary confinement?
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
It isn't?
That's a big comfort to me.
It's what?
Yes, ma'am.
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
There you go with those moves again.
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
What if he's not?
How about what?
Anything.
Why'd you do that?
You want to go ballistic?
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
You ever fly an F-14? 
Just good luck.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
Where are we?
No.
I want it back.
You don't believe that.
How do you play reality.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
Goose is dead.
Now?
One more.
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Ohhh Mother!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
Why do you all have such funny names?
Did what?
That's not what I heard.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
What are you doing?
You ever done this before?
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
Great move. Great
Come on, we're next.
What the hell is this?
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
1000.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
You saved our lives. You did it!
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
Who's the hell is that?
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
You won?!!!
Morning, Coogan.
He's a good pilot.
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
I can take care of myself.
You may not think so, but you are.
Not something they tell dependents.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
You think I shouldn't fly.
What's wrong with this one?
Where's yours?
What happened to them?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
Need a ride?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
You open it.
Suppose I do...then what?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
HER!
What, aliens?
I don't know.
They sell fake memories.
Yeah.
No shit...
What are you, my father?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
Shit!
I've got a lock!  There!
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
Is that better?
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Well...What do you say?
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
Let me finish!
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
I suppose you're not here either.
I'm not interested in that.
I'm not falling for it.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Not bad, for a hooker.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
I don't need Kuato for that.
You sure about this?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Wait!
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
How much you think?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I might have an idea...
So...now what?
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
You go north, I'll go south.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
What the hell are you doing?!!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
We playing cards tonight?
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
Come on.  Get away from it!
And I appreciate it.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Darn it!
Ready?
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
I brought it... to the coroner.
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
Gimme back my bottle.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
You can't remember that -- !
Not the whole time, of course. I --
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
You're implying that I planted a gun?
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
What other case?
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
Eddie Dowd.
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
...Jesus!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Murder witness.
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
-- Find him?
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Racist asshole came at me.
-- About what?
What went down?
No. You tell me, Shu.
No.
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
I did two tours in 'Nam...
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
No.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
The phone company was broken up.
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
No... No, go away.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
I'm nearly out.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Let's ditch this place and party.
We can do it right here.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
Is there a golf course around here?
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
You try that you little monkey.
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
And no one found the ring?
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
A blue rose.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
What is it?
She lived alone.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Noooo...
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Goodbye, Muffin.
What are you doing?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
You're not mad at me?
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
You got it.
The pages are gone. That's real.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
Right on time, baby.
James...
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
What about tonight?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Bobby killed a guy.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Can I take the car?
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Where's Dad?
School?
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
Dad?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Bobby didn't give you this?
When's the next business trip, big fella?
What's wrong?
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
You're right. There's no one here.
How good's your intelligence?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
He was accused of jury tampering.
...tell me about this case.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
...of Anesthesiology?
Mr. Concannon...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
What is this going to cost?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
I didn't do too well for you.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
And you wrote that...
Dr. Gruber...
Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
Do you know who her doctors were?
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Hi.
I need an extension for my case.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
I object, your Honor...
Exception!
D'you find an apartment?
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Maybe I can do something right.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Is it over?
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
You know what happened.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...You saw her?
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
He saw her at the Northern Care...
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
Another, Frank...?
...hey, I don't need your charity...
Mick. Mick. Mick...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Been a long time, huh...?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
What the hell are you doing here?
She told me.
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Yes.
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
There's nobody left around here now.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
Is that... machine...?
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
Nothing there now.
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
Colonel - shooting's no good!
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
Must be somebody in there.
They'll understand us, all right!
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
Heather?
He's had some sort of...episode.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Diabetes?
Like what?
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
These look quite fresh.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
He's on his way.
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
Do you have to die to see God?
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
In what, a romantic comedy?
You didn't jump in.
Seemed, not was.
I've never mentioned it to him.
You got it.  What's happening?
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Fred Krueger did it.
The car's no there yet?
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Captured?  How?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Then what is he doing?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Can I get you something to drink?
Did we lose anybody?
Looks like weather.
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Come in.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
Where you going?
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
I couldn't have done it without you.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Why then.
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
Sorry to here it.
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Northeast sir!
What's on your mind?
Well, spit it out.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
But you invited is aboard.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
What is it we can do for you today?
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
And being sixteen.
What's that?
Me, too.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
About yourself?
How long you been standing there?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Y'all take American Express?
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
I'm from all over.
No.
No.
Whattaya mean family?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
What happened on the charges?
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
What?
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
I'm scared, mama.
Hey baby...
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
That don't seem fair.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Actin' funny how?
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
What's that, peanut?
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
What was this one?
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
You ready for this?
More'n likely.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
How much we got left, honey?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
You're scarin' me, baby.
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
There's worse places, honey.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
Sailor? You know what?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
So where'd you say you was?
Let's leave here.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Just a place.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Through the forehead?
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
Santos... What's happenin' here?
What?...
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
You're stoned.
Mm.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
I just mean...
He said something about being between things.
That was good.
What's this guy's problem?
Kidnapped? By who?
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Came to my senses.
No...
I passed out.
I've been trying to finish a book...
No. There's no one here.
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
Hello?
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
So what are you doing out here?
Is that really it?
Go ahead.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Can I ask you something about her?
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Want me to get that?
Yes.
Isn't this...?
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
When we fall, we fall hard.
Kinship. And what's here?
The one that left you?
What?
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
But, last night...
You coming?
When?
I'm not going, with them.
Near Carvel?
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.
Professor Tripp...?
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
He cribbed that from Borges.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Not have it.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Pow.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
Who's that sitting in your car?
Sara.
Someone stole my car.
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Yo, Traxler.
Holy shit. Are you serious?
And?
Hardapple?
No, the dog.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Foreman now.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
What are you doing?
Cherry.
Fucking Mariners.
It's not what you think.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
What are you looking at?
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
How does it sound?
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
What are you writing in that book?
Don't you have friends?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Hiya, Walter.
Do you believe in them?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
You knew her?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
I'm twelve.
Robin?
How do you know?
I'd like you to keep a journal.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
You have no feelings for your niece?
I mean, when will I be normal.
Will I ever be normal?
How do they know?
You don't know!
I don't know.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
No, I am not going to --
Who do you see?
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
A nap?
Don't ever do that again.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
I'm only asking questions.
You felt pleasure.
Did you get an erection?
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
Want a ride?
I'm talking about you.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Doesn't it get noisy?
What about bears?
Tell me about it.
Is that all?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
Look, you can go now.
Sorry.
I never hurt them. Never.
What was prison like?
You mean the time you're locked away?
I'm sorry, Walter.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
Being here, with me.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
It's a bad idea.
What's this?
Thank you.
What's going on?
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
You wanna know what I think?
What are you still wearing that for?
What happened?
But what did he see that made him panic?
What's the scoop, ace?
Need some help?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Jesus, Lindsey--
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
You owe me one, Virgil.
Well, that's that.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Hello, Brigman.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Did you find Wilhite?
Virgil?
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Is that it?  Is this right?
'Fish'?
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Quiet!  Quiet!
SHIT!
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
What kind of light?
Then how come you're not with him?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
How are you?
But where are you going?
Did you sleep well?
But how could you say such a thing?
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
Are you feeling better?
Yes, you should go.
Oh, Sandro...
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
That's why I asked you...
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
What are you saying?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Good night, my love.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
What happened?
Looks like the weather is changing.
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
And what are we going to do now?
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Why don't you try?
Yes, sir. Three times.
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
We have a radio like this, too.
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Anything new develop?
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
Why have we stopped?
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
Zuria?
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
I can't say.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
No I don't... the host is enough.
I don't know.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Should you see a doctor?
Let's talk about something else.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Who?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Do you think he loves you?
And you like that?
Where do you meet?
I went to my room.
I got sicker.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Anything?
Why should I?
What else did she tell you?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
What things?
Why not?  Mmm?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
What did you do?
She's dead isn't she?
Yes?
Why?
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Who am I?
And why am I here?
Why?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
And then what happened?
Of what?
Is someone in the room with you?
Agnes, can you hear me?
So I could go to him.
She'd seen him too.
No...
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
She took the baby in her arms?
What did you do?
Look into the convent records.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
Marie's dead Mama.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Yes.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Do you still go to church?
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
You can call me Sister.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
I believe Agnes is different.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
You hate us don't you?
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
I'm only interested...
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
All right, what do you need.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Oh, Dear God...
Your niece!
Listening to angels?
She molested her!
We'll see about that.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
May I be present?
The father!
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Too late for what?
And the baby.
You tied the cord around its neck.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
That's enough.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Yeah.
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah.
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Are you going in?
I don't snore.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
Gerron.
Sure. .
Ringo!
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
What are we waiting for?
No, I didn't you did ...
Oh!
I see.  Do you like the play?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Pity.
Yes.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
And what's it all come to in the end?
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Where are you off to?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
What are you doing?
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
That little old man.
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Gie's a kiss!
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
I'll brook no denial!
Hello.
And my nose...
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
You're a window rattler, son.
He's betrayed the class.
That's mine.
Down the ... er ...
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
Eh, what's all this?
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Engines off.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
I don't recognize that constellation.
Any rotation?
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
How long to fix?
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
Why, what's wrong?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
It's clear.
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
He's running a fever.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
We've got six hours left.
It will be.
What do you mean, no?
Oh no.
What's happening up here?
That must have been when he got it.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
What's wrong?
This looks ancient.
What'd he say?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
<u>What is it</u>?
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
Not a one.  It's dead.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
But?
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
Where are you?
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
Kill me...
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Seal everything now!
Give or take.
Are you alright?
Where is she?
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Oh, man...
De Vries?
Whoa, wait a minute...
Forget it, man.
Hold it, hold it...
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Already working on it.
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Thanks.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Four.
Six month stint on Datus.
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I've found Ackland!
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
So, what do you think?
That's the wrong way!
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
You have to...
And what is your name?
May I come in?
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
You take charge.
I don't think that's funny.
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
Addison...
I didn't mean just the Theater.
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
I can't believe my ears...
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
That's not true!
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Because I don't want to.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Bill!
You've already met.
Right here. A minute ago.
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
When? When are you going to do it?
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
I told her. I sounded off.
Knit me a muffler.
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Many happy returns of the day...
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
I'll check with Eve...
Need any help?
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
So she seems.
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
What fire and music?
The kid. Junior.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
Paranoiac!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Don't be condescending.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
It's not nonsense.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
Never try to outguess Margo.
Yes, dear.
A cowboy.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Hello, what's your name?
I don't have to. I want to.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
So few come back...
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
You think?
You hear all kinds of things.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
The same size?
How do you do, my dear.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
Not at all.
You're not going, are you?
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
Mrs. Richards.
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
May I have your coat?
Oh, but there is-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
He can help you.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Addison wants me to play it.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
Did you see it here in New York?
What - again?
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
I've got it.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
She's just outside the door.
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Do you want it on?
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
I remember.
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
What time is it?
Lloyd, be careful...
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
What's so funny?
Who is it? What's it all about?
How about calling it a night?
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
How's the new one coming?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
To you, too?
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
I don't think I could be.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
You get quick action, don't you?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
Promise.
Are you breaking the contract?
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
That was fun.  What now?
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
We understand your problem--
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
Nah.  Maybe.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
Donald Segretti?
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
Do you feel much about the things you did?
Tell that to Muskie.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
But you know who did.
--you got more than one source?--
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--no--
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
Hey... very tense.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
One minute but then--
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
So tell me about the Times article.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
--what do you think?--
--I'm sure--
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
They are not my clients.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Talk about Segretti--
How grand?
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
Your name, please.
Where?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
But it's possible.
So?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Howard--
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
A boy or a girl?
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
No, it was good.
I'll do it.
Good work, Ostreicher.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Good morning gentleman.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
You don't like it?
Stifler told me.
Onions?
You want onions?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
This isn't any better, Chris.
What?  We both have cars.
That's not why we're going out.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
...I've never tried it.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
No you haven't.
No comment.
Give it to me!  Yes!
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
You can send me the address too.
But, but -- what would I do?
Hey, minuteman.
How do you know that?
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Can I come in?
I know, Dad.
Yes dad.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
You guys got the Latin homework?
This was remade?  Into what?
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Yes.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Jim...
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
Ho-lee shit.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Oh...ungghhhhh!
See -- this is the nicest room.
You comfortable?
Yeah.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Yeah Vick?
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
That junior chick?
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Either way works for us...
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Ha-ha!
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
What about your glasses?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
What the fuck!? You too!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
We don't both have to die.
Didn't even have to ask.
What does it say?
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Before the coma!
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
Where is it! Please!
What do you mean, maniacs?
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Enough. Cut him loose.
Andy!
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
No! I look ridiculous!
Ouch!  That really hurt!
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Come on!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
I'm so scared...
No! Well, yes, but
Don't let me go!
Who are you, child?
Do you remember this?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Don't you, child?
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
What was that?
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
What do you want?!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
Please, if you'd just listen...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
What's your name?
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
It's an important issue.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
We've been through this.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
The alarm clock.
Oh!
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Well, then, w-who was?
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Oh - you're an actress.
Uh, you're driving a-
Your grammy!
Sylvia Plath.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Fifteen years, huh?
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
I know.
what I mean?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
And blind people, crippled...
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Don't you think I do?
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Oh, you have my body.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
You're so sure about it.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
I'm following you and David, if you-
What?
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Two?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Okay, let me have this.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Happy birthday.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
What?
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
Alvy.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
What-
Oh, you got a headache!
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
Charlie Chaplin.
Sixteen years ago.
Just give me the license, please.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
We do the show live in front of an audience.
How about a ginger ale?
There are no twos, Max.
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
But she's colored.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
Well, hi!
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
Isn't Skye amazing?
The movie.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
She already has.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Why didn't you bring him?
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
You should have brought him.
He's gonna miss his flight.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
Take good care of it.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
The suspense is killing me.
You need to call your dad.
And you know our friends, how?
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
You're out of your mind.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
What did you get me?
I mean, you're really back.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Still champions.
Don't be so sure.
She left the fucking gate open.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
It's not like this all the time.
About me!
What are you saying?
Yes.
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Happy anniversary.
Has she called?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Yes, she is.
Yes.
No.
Don't I find what?
Ours.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And Ryan works at home.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
What am I, five?
Lemon or raspberry?
Ryan's really angry with me.
How do you do, Skye?
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
I...
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Is there space here?
That was my clue.
Are you lovesick?
She's even better looking in the flesh.
How?
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Shit!
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
He's a novelist.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
I trust you.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Well good.  Thank God.
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
General -- we have to talk sometime!
Really?
You're right!
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Water...water...
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
Z!  what are you doing?
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
You new, kid?
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
Not that one.  Or that one.
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
...Not enough food?
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
Yes, what else?
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Time to cut a rug, Z!
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Yeah, I know.
This the place?
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Say, you got a lulu.
Oh, I never catch colds.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
I hope everything goes all right.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
What is it?
Your phone.
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
I am. Let me get the cards.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Who was that?
In this house, you're supposed to.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Oh.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Baxter?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
This?
Not that I have anything to hide.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
To me?
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Sir?
You're going to take her off my hands?
You like?  It's all yours.
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
Very clever.
I dig.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
What's her name?
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Who is Mickey?
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Say, this is Snugsville.
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
Sleeping pills.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
What for?
Yes, I know.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Remember what we talked about?
You're not being funny.
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
What !
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
No -- absolutely not --
We've been attacked.
Which part is that ?
Rangers, eh?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
I was an FO for the 25th.
Sometimes.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
A sauciere --
Whatdoya think it thinks.
And the grass?
That's a light down there --
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Well, get in there.
I --
Listen.
Who knows? Right.
You didn't like him.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
Spooky.
Yeah.
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
Where've you been riding, Lance?
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
How big it is?
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
Fucking savages.
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
You've gone crazy.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
What's that?
You hear it again?
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
You think?
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Well , who's in command here?
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
Avalanche season is coming.
Let's go.
...I won't let a killer walk!
165  CONTINUED:  
212  CONTINUED:
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Had?
How did she..?
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
What happened here?
Where'd you say Eric is?
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Thanks.
Did you catch Corbett?
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
That's not what I meant.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Leave it here.
Ben Corbett?
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Desmond.
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Can you walk?
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Alleged killer.
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
What is it you want? What?
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
I'm sorry.
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
Have they done blood tests on him?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
I know. He's just the best.
Sorry.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
Oh, please...
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
What about your mother?
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
What's this?
I can't. I work.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Hello?
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
And mean it...
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
You don't owe me that.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't.
Hello.
How you doing?
Okay to say something now?
Grouchy?
What job?
Boyfriend?
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Was this supposed to be your room?
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
But what about...
Help!
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
How's Verdell doing?
She's nice.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
How you doing, great one?
No. Please, don't force him.
Is he dead yet?
Absolutely.
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Did you... do something to him?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Would you leave now, please?
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
You going to come talk to me or not?
What's wrong?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Why are you doing this?
Uh, Fontella's
Where you from?
Why?  What happened?
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What are you doing?
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
Okay.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
What does that fucking mean?
Michael?
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
You think this is a fucking joke?
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
An assassin?
Who is that other guy?
I don't need the money.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
With computers.
No, they didn't.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Women?  No... not really.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
My first take?
Why?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
No.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
In Costa Blanca.
Where did you learn it?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Did you think they were newlyweds?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Nobody ever sees me.
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Yes.
Were you attracted to me right away?
That doesn't sound normal.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
I wasn't watching television.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
Do you ever think about starting over?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
How would you like the funds?
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
Cheers Katka!
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
How to make a buck!
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Like a hand?
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
No, We aren't going to do it.
And a tram hit you?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Chris! Tell me some good news.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
What about me?
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Take this exit.
It's that one isn't it.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
I could pencil you in if you like?
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
I don't want to get in trouble.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
If you get out can we be together again.
I don't understand, it's your home?
Hi, want to take up dancing?
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
And take Jiri with you?
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
What's the Bugler?
A champion of lost causes huh?
Who you saving the dishes for?
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
Where did you steal the car?
You will wish you hadn't.
Why did you break into that particular building?
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
Hey Doug, where you been?
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
That's my bag.
It's more than what you're worth.
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are quite sure it's secure?
You are responsible...What has happened?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
What if they expel you?
Out with Belinda?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Were you with Jamie?
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
What are you doing here?
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
Hypotheticals --
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
'Is it really me?'
You think so.
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
You're really into God, right?
Or anywhere where people might see us.
You were great the other night.
I haven't been nice to you.
Maybe you inspire me.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
It's a start.
What does that mean?!
Hey.
Like fire.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
We can measure wind.
When did you build this?
So what do you want to see?
What are you going to -- ?
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
What are you thinking?
I've talked to your father.
How you doing?
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
How're you doing?
Will you do something for me?
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
What's Landon Carter up to?
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
You're in the play?
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
This week.
How about your family?
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Now I can do what I want.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
So what did we just make?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
Morning Dick.
Here's your jacket!
Hi, Marty.
You remember me...?
Hi, Marty!
Why what?
Maybe if I used my left....
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
You have a name?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
What?!
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
You answered the door!
An atomic bomb.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
I know.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Obviously!  
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
You like people?
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Well, Kit...
Good luck to you.
Sure is pretty.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
No, you're not either.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Okay.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Nothing.
Quit my job.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
You're a redhead.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
You know what I think?
Don't call me stupid.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Don't.
That's Montana over there.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
What?
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Hi.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
You tossed my hat out the window.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Planet 10?
Then what?
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
You're a welcome sight...
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Did you say..."Peggy"?
He offered you money?
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Never.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I see.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
Chet!
I write.
No, I – I didn't mean to sound –
Well that's what he said.
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
...Huh? No, I'm –
I'm a writer. Ted O –
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
...That's fine.
Sound a little what?
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Howdy, neighbor.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
Yeah, but –
So they say.
...Can I come in?
Hold on –
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Yeah, but Charlie –
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
What did... What did he –
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
Mr. Lipnik, I –
There's no smoking in this building.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
How about the booze?
How about the coke?
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
You should do something about this lock.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
What's your new book about?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
Even though you were fucking him.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
Am I... disturbing you?
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
I like you.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Did you think it was so special?
What did you think?
How's your shoulder?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
You shouldn't play this game.
You're in over your head.
No.
Do you believe me?
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
Why?
I finished my book.
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
Did you ever tie him up?
How did he die?
You have the right to an attorney.
What kind of drugs?
Nope, can't say that I do.
Was she ever a suspect?
What kind of talk?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
You think I --
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
You feeling better?
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
If she's telling  you the truth.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
So what do we do -- nothing?
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Hey – it's the big A.M..
When's your show?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
Of what?
Saddle River, New York!
New York.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Piss painting?
When?
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
What do you mean?
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
Paint it out.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Blue? Where?
You're shattering all my myths.
Check you later, man.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
We got beat.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
You're back.
I'm your family.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
It looks done.
... babies.
What's wrong with me?
What's that?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
That is amazing. What year is it?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were –
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
I really... admire you.
Come on.
You see? You have someone to live for.
What? What do you want?
So shut up and keep painting..
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
I guess this mean we won.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
Pouring myself into my work.
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
Son!
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
Working late?  I'm touched.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
I love you, old man.
It's good to see you.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
This is easy.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
We gotta get those locks changed.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
You're not even listening to me.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
That's gotta hurt.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
How about dangerous curves?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
It'll never work.
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
Master, Bruce?
All the answers are numbers.
What now sir?
Al?
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
To kill me.
He sure did.
Why do you do that?
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Back off, man.
You can't-.
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
I'll show you it works.
How'd you find us?
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
A-14.
B-12.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
GET IN THE CAR!!
It doesn't protect your head, though.
What is that?
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
Great.  Give me a grant.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
I don't sing very well.
All street mimes should be executed.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
Keep her on the line!
Got it!
We got 'em!
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
Joker here. Can we talk?
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
No.
Where does one man get all this junk?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
You are on drugs.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
And what did you say?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
It isn't working any more, David.
Jesus.
Go ahead.
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Here, let me do that.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Big day today, huh? 78
What happened?!!!
Oh yes.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
You're not going to ....
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
David, David, David ...
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Welsh.
Well, there is that ...
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
Shut up, Kevin.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Damn, huh huh.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
Uh... bye-bye.
Bunghole...
Beavis.
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Talk ta me, Bork.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Do her? Huh huh.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Really? That's where we're from.
You scored with two chicks?!
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
Maybe this is heaven.
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
My God, we're back where we started.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
What happened?
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
Honey.  Let's go.
And your sushi was remarkable.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
What is going on?
All right.  Who are you?
Just one daughter.
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
Tell the truth.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
I don't know what that signal means.
Beetle!
So... You're ready for me now?
Can you help <u>me</u>?
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Just don't tell Lydia.
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Are they suffering?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
What's wrong?
What do you think?
<u>Oh my God</u>!
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Otho, that's terrible.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
Would you care for a drink?
I would like to watch television.
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
... Why... No, I don't think so...
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey!
Your leg must be getting better.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Chauncey...
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Yes, it is very good!
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Bravo!
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Certainly, Ben.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
... Then you really are a gardener?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
Good day, Mr. Chance.
... My suitcase.
... Evening, Chance.
Yes. I've seen that done.
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Since you were a child?
How were you paid?
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
Yes. It has.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
No headaches?
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... Would you take me on a tour?
It's that gardener!
No! He's a real gardener!
Good night.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
... So what does all that add up to?
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Hi.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I want to try.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
A better friend.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
Dr. Lester. . .
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
What?
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
You're late.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Lotte, this is so good...
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
No.
Impressions? Those are hard.
The Great Mantini?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Forget it.
Yes, my dear?
Thank you, Floris.
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Is there dancing?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Darling!
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Good-bye, Maxine.
There ain't.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You saying nothing counts?
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
You don't sit with me!!
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
I want somethin' sweet.
Your mother all right?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
They good whitefolks?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Morning.
I know Denver.
Can't locate him.
The church!
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
You shaved.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
What, baby?
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Where'd she been?
Uh-huh.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Can we just rent it from you?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
He peed on the Dude's rug--
If what's during league play?
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Howdy do, Dude.
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Yeah, but my-
Well--sure, I could do that--
And please don't call her my mother.
Dieter Hauff?
Well...yeah--
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Finder's fee?
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
This was, uh--
No, but--
Donny!  Please!
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
Just for making the hand-off?
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
That...fucking...bitch!
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
That wasn't her toe.
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
They're nihilists.
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
It is a fucking emergency.
Walter, you fuck!
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
What's mine is mine.
It's a heart attack.
Walter Sobchak.
You make everything a fucking travesty!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude here.
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Dude.
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
Is this a--what day is this?
Huh?
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Well?  Aren't you?
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
Whatta we do about the Mex?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
What was that?
how long since he was bitten?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
What do you really think?
What's your problem, Whistler?
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
Put it back in park, Blade.
You got something in mind, Blade?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
Nomak?
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
What the fuck you doing?
From his father, of course.
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
Whistler!
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
What took you so long?
You're not going anywhere.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
What is this place?
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
How could you be a part of this?
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
But you use blood banks --
You're a monster.
Blade --
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
We keep in radio contact.
Whistler!
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
No!
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
--<u>myth</u>--
You want me to scooch over next to you?
I think we get the gist.
--now c'mon!
Just now?
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
There, what? I didn't see anything.
The witch?
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
I don't believe this.
Nice tent.
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Mi casa y su casa!
Where <u>is</u> it?
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
Boy Kurth.
Where?
That's a "j."
Who?
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
Okay, but--
403 41st Street, kids: home.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
Oooh. Oooh.
Pointless.
What's that?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What'd you see?
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Elly Kedward?
What?
What're you afraid's going to happen?
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Okay. Hypothetically.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
What the fuck's going on here?
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
Your mother's pastor.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
...Drive me to a motel?
On the phone. Was it for you?
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
I could've sworn I heard something.
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...You called me this morning.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...Where is everything?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
So how long have you know Meurice?
Sure don't.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
What did you take these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
Now that don't make much sense.
...Anything else?
Yeah. Is it...
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Don't throw that out.
What's this?
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Howdy stranger.
What day is it today, Angie?
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Frank. Come in.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
What color is it?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Is Sandy part of this?
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
. MOMMY!.
Yes, but.
Frank gone?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
That oughta do it.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
THEN WHAT?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Don?
You don't?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
. I. uh.
I liked being with you last night.
Nice guy.  Who's he?
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Yes. Frank-
Do you like my body?
Are you a bad boy?
You like to open me. don't you?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You. what?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Are you alright?
What's the plan.
Yeah. but.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Okay. thanks.
What did you see?
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
What am I going to do?
You worry about me really?
You didn't tell him about me?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Really?
NO.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Probably not. no. Why?
Are you feeling okay?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
God. you scared me.
No. you're right.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Would you like a piece of cake?
He comes over to study.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
Surprise.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
Tuna, this is crap.
Excuse me?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
The coca is my responsibility!
Mirtha.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
What's that?
No?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
What do you got there, Diego?
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
No, my brother.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Oh my G-d.
How are we doing?
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
What's the matter, George?
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
I know.
George.
Touche.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Where do I put this!?
There's no room.
Are you comfortable with this?
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Mexico.
Barbara.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
Yeah.  Nice.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
I want money.
Money.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
You mad at me?
Hi.
Give this to Mom, will you?
I meant every word of it.
How are you doing, George?
Figured it out.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
George.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
Look what the cat dragged in.
Why are you smiling?
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Alright.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
What do you want?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
I don't know.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
I swear.  On my life.
I fucked up.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
You afraid of these ...?
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
No ...
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
What is she saying?
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
You did a good job, Charlie.
So she knew about his heart?
Yeah.
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
That's what my report will read.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Can you?
She's innocent.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
That's ridiculous.
Can I go?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Why did you come by?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
What about Miss Lawson?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Is it Marsh?
Who found him?
She was here?
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
What happened next?
Why not?
She was.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
Did you ever see her again after that?
Why?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
October twenty-seventh.
I heard him say it.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Then what happened?
Did he make your life miserable?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
What do you have in your purse?
Hi, Joe.
Yes.
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
How?
Is it against the law?
Yes -- she did.
Sorry.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Really?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
But Your Honor--
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
Is that alright, Frank?
Please -- not now.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
Yes.
Did Marsh use it?
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
How bizarre!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
Lawyer here?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
I bet mom could've helped her.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
She's changed.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Pretty country.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Oh. When did you move back?
Oh there you are.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Oh, that's nice.
About a year and a half.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
Why doesn't it scare you?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Francesca?
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
Where was she?
Sleep all right?
Stop it!
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Where you going?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Don't feed that dog.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Hell no!
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
You think that's really him?
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
You soundin' like the old man now.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
We can climb out.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
You got a nice crib here.
Let me see your hand.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
How do you know?
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
What the hell do you want?
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
Nice rack.  How old is --
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
Jimmy Bones?
You haven't?
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Not really to live, just to play.
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
Open the case!
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
Where is it?
No, Gino!
She's doing the work herself.
Not bad.  What for?
Caesar, what happened?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
That doesn't make any sense.
What?
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
I need you ...
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Tell them!  Tell them!
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Shut up, Violet!
Violet!
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
You know he would have done you, too.
Not on duty, sorry.
You can't kill me yet.
Okay, sure, Mick.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
Is that the money?
Hello?
So this is temporary for you?
'63 Chevy.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Caesar is your husband?
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
A beer?
Curious, maybe.
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
I wanted to apologize.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
No.
How long have you been with him?
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
I don't understand - ?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
I don't.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
And where is it now?
It's in a case, on his desk.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
What happened?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Where will you be?
Why?
He'll have to run.
Done.  We go now.
Johnnie, what did I say?
Yes.
And what if I couldn't do that?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
What do you mean?
Treadstone.
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
Who do you think sent me?
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Sir, you waited on line.
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Paris?
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
Jesus...
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
I needed a break.
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
Where?
-- let me do this, okay? --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
-- we'll tell them what happened --
What is that?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
And that's it?
Where did this body go?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
What the hell're you talking about?
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What the fuck is he doing?
What?
-- what're you talking about? --
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
... And then some.
You telephone, sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
... fix themselves.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
Sign here, please.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
In fact, killing people -
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
You are late.
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
What?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
It could all be coincidental.
Jack?... Jack?
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
You think these are tits don't you?
Are you alright?
Ow! That hurt!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why?
No, really.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
They'll be there waiting.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
What happened to you after ...
Don't you like parties?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Tuttle?
Try next of kin.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
That's it.
Can I forget it?
You want to take my console into your office?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
How long will she he away?
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Whatever happened to you?
Er, don't you want to search me?
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
What is it?
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Can you fix it?
Are you expecting anyone?
What do they want you or?
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
Es impossible.
Where is she?
She asked me to pick her up.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
I guess I'll be going.
What about Kanita?
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Do you have any music?
Is there any chance?
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
You shouldn't smoke.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
Yes?
Sleeping.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
I hate vodka.
Where you going?
He got better.
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
Last show of the night.
Where's Burke?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Would you like to come in?
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
Where you going?
Whatja doing?
The brakes are shot.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
Faster! God!
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
Wait.
Okay.
It's nice to see you.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
That's your full name?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Watch? --
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
Do others feel that you did well?
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
What?
How?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
Ready.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
The cost-efficient reporter.
Just a few questions?
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
But thanks.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Play back the last line...
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
No...no.
I really have to go.
Yes.  How do you know?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Hi.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I've got another story.
I didn't think you'd make it.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
It's not important.
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
What?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
What happened?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Okay.  Good night.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
No.  Did he really?
What?
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
Then give me a minute...
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
I knew what you meant.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
This is very awkward.
You're saying stay away from him.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
Don't you work here?
Would you like to do me?
If you were an artist you could have created something!
A girl with a body like mine?
Alright we're clear.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Hi Walter.
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
Did you hear what he said?
I mean, you look so pretty.
I like you very much, Walter.
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Walter...there's...
Walter...stay away from me!
Put it in the middle of the room!
Walter...I can't believe it.
Murdered...man?...
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
I wonder what his deal is.
There's that weird dude again.
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Hiya Carla.
You didn't mean to what?
A show..how soon can we go?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
How ya doin'?
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
After that we go no more!
I won't say good luck, Walter.
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
What's all the noise in here!
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Well, um... litter?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Did you see a girl come by here?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
What's Bobby gonna say?
Something like that.
What show is this?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
You left me a message?
I am a God!  A God!
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
They were vampires, weren't they?
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Dress, huh?  What for?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Leave me alone.
That's me.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
Beverly Center.
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Excuse me for having something important to do.
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
Why?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Time to do what?
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
All right.  What do we do now?
Meet me at this address after school.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Who we gonna beat?
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
How can you keep doing this?
There isn't time.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
Come one, that was so weird.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
The mark of the Coven.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
What happened?
I never thought of that.
Buffy!
Oh, God.
I really was way way too too.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
No...  You want me to give him a message?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
How ya like that?
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
No.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
How 'bout a back rub?
No!  You're playing with my mind!
I think you're real cute.
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
She's dancing with me.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Damn.
Don't tell anybody.
Your place or mine?
He' s confused--
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Why baseball?
Why not?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Oh dear....easy honey...
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
He's a good student.
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
What's that?
You a God damn witch?
Will that work for me?
Don't bump me.
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Why you shaking me off?
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Can I ask you something?
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
Why am I a fuck?
Nuke--  Good luck.
Take the first shot at me.
I'd kill ya.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
He even played golf with the President.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
No, you're not calm.
Oh, good.
Hey!
Yeah.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
...very difficult to get in.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
Just say so.
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
All right.
Yeah.
My wife?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Please...
...don't do it to me...
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
I just told you. She called me.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Okay. You come by the house?
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
...and she doesn't always -
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
To Abraham Lincoln.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
Right?
Hi. Nice to see you.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Hello.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
...under?
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
With the money.
I bought him a watch too.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
To the Riviera.
She had the same.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I wouldn't -
You are not threatening me anymore!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
...Well, I've got a large family.
Loose machines are right back over there.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Look what they did to my hand, man!
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
...I got muscled on the street.
Yeah.
No, no? You didn't?
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
I don't want to go to Europe.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
Can I go in?
You just - Just stop him.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Leave me alone!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
Hey, Frankie.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
You got a round figure on it?
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Fine.
Hi, Jennifer.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Sure.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
Thank you.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
You know?
Yes, you did.
Yeah.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Well, how 'bout that?
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
Right.
He's sittin' by the phone -
They checked in alone.
Hey, how you doin'? 
Incredible.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
They're havin' a good time too.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Don't know.
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Frankie!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
You're a little confused?
My fuckin' head.
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
I know, but that's enough.
Hi.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
Works for me.
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
What's the matter...
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
How heroic of you...
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
You're kidding.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
What's the catch?
Car wash, Captain?
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
I'm a good mother!
Hey, you're anti-male.
Yeah, she's okay.
How much?
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Good morning.
You turned around!
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
You never miss a trick.
If you know that just back off.
Got your badge?
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Do I know you?
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
Lady, try making some sense.
Where'd they take you to?
What makes you say that?
Who?
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
I'm with two friends now.
Stop throwing names at me.
Hey drop it, okay?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
Our house always needs touching up.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
It won't be him.
Did you hear that click?
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Yes.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
Damned if I know.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
You, I would've noticed.
You were at the Emerald that night?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
They did some great job of reforming you.
Naturally.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
You're making it too easy.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
Where do we meet?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
Satisfied?
I don't know what you mean.
It's in the process.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
Yeah?
Who's this?
What does it take to kill you?
We're gonna get there first.
I thought so.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
He's what she should run a mile from.
You could always make it up to her.
See that, Col?
He's still looking, Col.
Ask him.
You see that, Col?
Fuck it, is what I say.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
Someone recommend you?
How'd you guess?
Jimmy.
Everybody wants something.
You all right?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Jesus Christ!
No.
What would he think?
Do you miss him?
Maybe.
You mean that?
What you thinking of, hon?
Tell him it hurt --
You could?
Sure I do.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Will you meet me again?
Do they know?
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Don't ask me in.
No. Can't pretend that much.
So I got it wrong, then.
Don't.
Dil, this is Jude.
Do you like me even a little bit?
You said anything, Dil
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You want to make me look like him...
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
I had to go to work!
What pills?
Good-bye, Dil
You didn't.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
More endearments.
Tell me you love me.
Then say it.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Dil!!!
Meet Col --
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Lucky you.
What was it?
Fergus!
So what do you need, Fergus?
You don't know that.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Eddie and Tinker died.
So you did fuck up.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Give him a cup of tea.
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
So he knows your name?
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
This is a farce, man.
How did you know it was her?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
They won't let him die.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
She'd be anyone's type.
Why not?
No?
She your wife?
Can't. Once I signed up.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Fergus?
Why?
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Do you?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
What?
Help me.
Go to sleep now.
What?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
I said you bastard -- stop --
What if I did?
And you know what?
Come and get me, soldier --
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Oh, you should see your face.
Adam!
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
I said, tell me to go to the --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Café.
Bartholomew?
But you're -- divorced?
Oh.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Back where?
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Scobie?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Who told you to do that?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
They've got Jean-Louis!
What day is it?
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
What's so illogical about that?
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
Why don't you shut up!
Are you going to listen?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
Yes.
The money is unimportant.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
Forty-five thousand.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
He was American?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
About how wealthy would you say?
Where did he keep his money?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
Of course it is.
Up there! It is up there!
But he is gone.
I don't know -- how would I know?
How's that?
Please, not on my account.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Is your husband with you?
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Shakespeare never said that.
Are you in the book?
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Come on. You can't stay here.
We'll find you a hotel.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
Who said?
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
Go on.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Yes -- that's right.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Stop that!
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
Who is it from?
I'm glad. But what's all this?
I don't see him.
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Shoot no, not after all these years.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Yeah?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
What did you hear?
No!
We need you here. I can bring her in.
Well?
What are you doing?
She's not here.
Of what?
She was murdered?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
Why?
Your brother told us.
You fucked me up!
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
What do you know about my father?
You're the killed.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
You can't tell your parents.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Why?
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
Are you coming to the party?
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
My dad's down there!
Hi mom.
Where are you going?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You're so beautiful.
I said no.
That wasn't me ...
Stacy?


Unbe-fucking-lievable.
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Since today.  New policy.
...and fair...
Oh.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
What did I say?
I need your truck.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
I got, uh....
Come on, get in the truck.

Yeah, borrowed!
I was thankin' you, asshole!
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...waiting!
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Oh, shit.
I think...
 Okay.

...wanna give it a try!
What the fuck was that?!
Gee, you think so?

Okay.  All right.  Okay. 

You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Oh, shit!
Oh, no!



I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
 Yeah.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Listen, Arlo...
Not completely, anyway.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.

Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.

We're gonna die!

Oh.
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
...to him. 
Stop.
Oh, shit.
Stupid.

What?
What?
...-ta get outta here!
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Hang on, hang on.

...truck that kept Elvis cool?
You, Arlo.
Us.  Owes us.
 Yeah.
I feel faint.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
I urge you to be persuasive.
...without compunction.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
...take my sorry old truck.
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
What?  Say again...
Exactly.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...


Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
...-bility.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
Mm-hm.
...always done, Richard?
"Went away."  I like that.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...

Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.

Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him.
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
...to die for a country that's...
Hello.
I don't see my container.
...-tainer!




Dead, last time I...


Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Hit it...
...tight!
Thanks. 
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...

How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
Call an ambulance.
The compound has to be kept cold...
Mason.  Mason!
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
 Listen, Pappas...
 Talk to me.
Arlo.

Oh.
I'll stay here and secure this position.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
An honest living.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Is she all right?
Haven't the faintest idea.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
How do you do that?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Hello.
You've got her? Where?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
What are you talking about?
She's just no good.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I'll throw that in too.
That's a filthy habit.
Where did you get this material?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Thanks, Lou.
I don't want it anymore.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
What are you talking about?
It's too late.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
My husband's at the office.
That's not his apartment.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
I mean I can't tell you.
Yes... why?
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
That dam is a con job.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
When was the last time?
As little as possible.
And I want to know where.
Where are you going?
I know.
I saw him.
What did he say?  What did he say?
It's possible.
Okay, give me the keys.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Did you get some sleep?
Going somewhere?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
That's good. Now what's her name?
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
I'll take care of it.
Walsh here?
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
The obituary column?
Who?
I'm sorry. We don't.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Mr. Gittes?
Do you know me?
It's bone dry, Morty.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Of course not.
No problem with me on the Job.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Neither do I.
Course, she settled down nicely.
That's for sure.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Will they really find work in Germany?
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Did you ever see her again? 
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
Hi, Elena!
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
Elena!...But when...
So what'd they say?
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
How long's it been shut?
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane -
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
Three cents.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
Who else did you see?
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
Was the show covered by every department?
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
I intend to find out.
Oh!!
Oh yes, there is.
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
You've got some on your face.
Oh!
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Where's the soap?
Would you sing for me?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Get Dr. Corey.
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Tired?
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
I mean I've got a job for you.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Yeah, all in crates.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Who told you you could sit down here?
How did you meet him?
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
She's plastered, isn't she?
Are you sure?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Yeah, but not in here.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
She said not to come home until graduation.
Am I missing something here?
He was?
When did you get back?
Well... kind of, sort of?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
No.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
You don't have anything to do with it.
You work in a market, all right.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
He's not invited.
You're such an asshole.
How'd you get here so fast?
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
This is the last time I come to this place.
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Who are you to make assessments?
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Pack of cigarettes.
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
Cute cat. What's his name.
What time do you have to stay till?
What smells like shoe polish?
She called me Brad.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
I think it's safe to say yes.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
How do you mean?
I guess.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
What did he say?
No.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Because you buckled.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Shit. What about tomorrow?
You hardly knew her!
She meant nothing to you!
I can't close the store.
Broke his neck.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
What the fuck did you do that for?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
You're happy to get a fine?
You're kidding.
You're a snake.
She said she did all the work.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Make them change.
How's your eye?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
You still didn't have to choke me.
To talk to you.
Are you open?
Just the paper.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
What's that mean?
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
You used to go out with her?
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Oh... Can I help you?
The white kind.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I was kidding.
And I actually date you?
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
It better be up to and including me.
Three?
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Where?
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Yeah, right.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
How many?
How many dicks have you sucked?!
HOW MANY?
A few?
I feel sick.
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
And that made you feel better?
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
What the fuck did you do that for?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
I didn't do that!
He only speaks Russian?
No way!
What did he say?
Is he staying here?
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I beg your pardon!
That's the price, my brother.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
What the hell are you doing here?!
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Take the gun.
How're ya feeling?
Two...
He knows it well.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
I don't understand?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Resuscitation?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
Gabe!?
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Nice view, huh?
Can you see light?
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Gabe!
Reach up!  Do it!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Just kidding.
What about you?!
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
He'll freeze.
You said there was a way across.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Yeah...
Then where the fuck is!
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Right.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Don't use my name!
Don't give him anything.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
No names, this is an open line!
Rich...
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Been punished, yeah?
Great, sir. Great.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Fine, sir, fine.
What would you like to know, sir?
You've not been to school all week, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Helping you, sir?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Yes, sir.
Yes sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
No, sir.
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
You've heard Beethoven before?
And when do I get out of here then?
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
I've done my best, have I not?
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Hullo, son, how are you?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Shall we go to my office?
Sixth is faster.
You like Bach?
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
You like being a lawyer?
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
But not now?
You need a vacation.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
You still carrying passengers?
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
What kind of question?
I picked up a tail.
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
What are you gonna do?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
I'm in town for a short time.
You're gonna cheer up.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
How long you think this'll take?
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
First time in New York?
It's home.
You prefer nights?
You should start a union.
No.  You say you're cool.
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
Try some deep breathing.
You better?
What are you doing?
58th and Central.  You know it?
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Are you breathing?
Music.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Get rid of 'em.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Another collateral.
Jazz.  Music.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Max?  What are you doing?
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
How long have you been a hit man?
Who's Heller?
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
And you believe me...?
Slow the hell down!
What happened?
They said send you downstairs.
I never told her.
Look, I'm sorry --
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Saved you last night's, too.
I don't see the connection.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
Not for years.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
What was your horse's name?
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
What's the charge?
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Yes.
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
If my universe had a hub...
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
Please put it down.
He's why you punish yourself.
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
You look great.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
What is it?
We're going to Queens?
Now what?
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
I don't understand.
Did you kill my father?!
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Love at first sight?
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
I'm sorry.
Blue moon...
Geronimo is down.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
Excuse me?
<u>Why you</u>?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
A dog.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
It's okay.  I'm game.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Is it possible...?
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
Peter sends his regards.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
What?
You...
You aren't staying?
What?
J39 Z186...?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
There is no direct evidence, no.
Talk to him.
So who -- what -- are you?
So we passed some kind of test?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
So.  What happens now?
It's time to go home now.
What kind of deal?
I didn't realize I was out.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
And in return?
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
I'd say this is slightly different.
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Ellie.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
Ellie -- are you okay?
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Did you love him?
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
I read your book.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
Ellie, what is it?
Hi.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Gotta have kings.
We saw the broads.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
So then you just call him.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
A cold drink? Okay?
That's my baby.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
What you mean, Luke?
But, Luke...
Luke. Where you goin?
Like I always do?
Man, it's so hot.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
Man Oh Man.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
It's good medicine.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
I want to die.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
We'll get the paramedics...
The first two murders.
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
Hello, Daryll Lee.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
In jail.
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Who?
Is it an ongoing case?
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
How do you know that?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
Tell me what to do!
The lock...
Don't hang up!
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
I was.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
It's none of my business anymore...
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
I heard. Good police work.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Absolutely.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
There was no sperm.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So what have we got?
Where you going?
How'd you get in on the deal?
He's not treating her right...
Did you come?
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
Have you seen it?
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
Have you seen his penis?
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Please finish your story.
Can you drive?
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
I want to see my mother immediately.
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
What's up with you?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Really?
You're slowing.
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Which flowers did you order?
I haven't had a crush since I was
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
Don't take it personally.
What are you looking to read?
We'll get caught.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
I wish I could have seen that.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Well?
Just checking.
Yeah.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
I love the pillows.
It's TV heaven.
Hey.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Not yet.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
Silly?   Silly am I?
Silly, silly, silly.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
So, another one bites the dust.
But what about that math project?
Are you all right?
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
No, you've done a perfect job.
You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
A pass.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
Hey man, you can't do that!
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Hello?
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Someone else coming?
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
And for my help I would get what?
I only have your word for that.
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
He said to go fuck yourself.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
I thought they came with batteries.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
Hello?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Guns.   Can you get them?
Don't bullshit me.
I'm from Belgium.
Everything.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
And the other car?
What hotel?
What room number?
What do we do?
They don't have a wine list.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
No, I didn't.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
How about Canada?
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
Give it to me, Sami.
No.   It's mine.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
Holy shit.
How do we know what room she's in?
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
Can't sleep?
Who are you waiting for?
You're back!
Yes.
Do you think you are a real master?
Why do you want to teach me?
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
Please.
No, really?
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
You, sister...
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
Good.  And how are you?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
No.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
Save your strength.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
They're gone.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
They couldn't do anything for me.
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
Top Dollar.
Neither.
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
We've got company.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
I'm Kathryn.
Nothing.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Got a boyfriend back home?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
I do.
Am I bothering you?
You know what? I don't take it back.
Because I'm in love with you.
Hi.
Hi.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Are you shitting me?
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
Where did you find those?
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
What are you saying?
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
What do you mean?!
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
If that's what you call it.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
What year are you in?
Excellent.
And then I can go home?
What are you doing?
I like it better when I'm on top.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Hi, mom.
Oh baby... oh baby...
Yes!
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Hello.
Yeah?
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Why not?
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
I'll think about it...
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
You would not believe what--
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
That her?
Shut up.
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
You didn't?
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
Well done.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
What do you want?
She's not here.
Right after we played backgammon.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
I said, do you want some water?
What time is it?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Hey Ronald.
You get your wish!
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
Did your wishes ever come true?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
I haven't had my breakfast.
But I told her to go with you.
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
Why didn't you run after them?
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
Who are you?
But where do you come from?
But where is that?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
It stands so still.
May I pet the deer?
But why?
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
I like stories.
The Headless Horseman --
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
On the dark nights — on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
What is it, ma'am?
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Waiter! She needs more water.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
I wonder if he's married.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Hello?
Get rid of him!
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Peter knows something.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
I thought you and George were getting married.
I wish I only had your problems.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
What?
You should have gone at the restaurant.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
Uh huh. So pee.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Wow.
Script coverage?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Was there anything in that washer?
Uh.... hi!
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
Except Mark of course.
Is that how you feel?
What's with the squirt guns?
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Go away. I might hurt you.
How do you know?
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
Here's a towel.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
No, I have a cat.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
How the hell is that your business?
See he was cheating from the get go.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
He means the last that we know of.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What kind of animal?
Thanks.  Just some pills.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
How long have you been here?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
In there.
What is this place?
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Dammit!
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
People...  after me.
They didn't have faces.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
I didn't realise...
What does she say?  The woman.
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
I'm sorry.  About before.
What are you hiding?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
What's with her?
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
I'm not certain about...
Mr. President...
That shelter was in this bill.
Choices???
What do you think you're doing?!
... what?
Fine?
Don't call the Vice President!
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
What I told him to?
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
... Sometimes they do.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
What's that?
Who?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
What?
... . Ellen.
Oh... Yeah.
Where's home?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
It could be fun.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
We're all set,  sir.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Then why did you come here?
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Sir. It's quite clear that...
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
What is it?
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
NOOOOOOOOO!
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Charlie Dalton.
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Oh God, it's over now!
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Mr. Keating!
Yeah?  Like what?
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
What happened? Were you kicked out?
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
That's your sister school, right?
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
But I love you.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
Again!  Louder!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
I was just looking in an old annual and...
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
Where are you going?
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
So?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
You the Captain?
How do we get out of here?
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
We were talking about my schedule...
Where are my men?
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Who gives a shit about aft?
Maybe we lost them.
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
Where's you friend?
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
What did you do the my kids!!
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
And what have you come up with?
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Where are you going?
Why don't you back off?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
What was that?
Check it out!
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Damn right!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
I thought that was it.
What the --!
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
Tell him, Vince!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
That's new, isn't it?
I got delayed. I --
Fucking A.
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
I have to go.
See, I'm going home.
You like to call me Linda now?
Get anything?
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Holy shit!
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Rough, huh?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
Frost.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
Who the hell is he?
You can do it, Sal.
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
That way it sets.
I just wait. You know?
You think about it?
Nick, he just came back.
What'd he say?
Promise! You gotta promise!
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
I like it, Nick.
That's it. No. No way.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Great. That's great.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Great. Hey. That's great.
What?
It's Merle, Sal.
Yeah.
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
No!
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
I want to ask you a few questions.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
I want to stop aging.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
I'm wasting time.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Kill him... kill him.
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Sir---
I drive.
I have to go home, Sanchez.
I'll inform dispatch.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Married?
I'll have a cup of coffee?
You want to be a good detective?
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
You treat her nice.
You okay?
You be careful.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
But he was such a good cop.
Bye.  Thanks.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
You're lying.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Anybody can see that.
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Grandma, look at me!
Howdy, Jabez.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
-- in gold.
Mornin', Jabez ...
Where's everybody?
What's the matter with you?
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Yes, why shouldn't it?
It's mine?
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
You know darn well it is.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Oh!
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Yes.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
He's stubborn as a Stone.
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Mary -- what would you do?
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Well -- I -- I-
But Jabez, I never said that!
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Mary! Come back ...
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Ma -- is she? --
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
What's that?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Me?
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
I want someone to talk to ...
I can't be honest with them.
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
You're all right, Argyle.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
What's happening?
Nothing...
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
The code key, please...?
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Yo!
Encourage them to be bolder.
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
What are you doing?
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
John!
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
Al?  Al, you there?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Hey, you couldn't know.
Powell?  What's going on?
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Is that him?
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Gene -- you smilin'?
You'll be okay.
What guns?
Yeah...
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Look... don't throw that on me.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
What kind of things, Leon?
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
How many you got in there?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
Calm down, you're not ...
He wanted to kill me!
What the hell you doin' back there?
Yeah ...
Yeah?
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
I must of been outta my mind.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You like me?
No you don't.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
You got Bank Americard?
You all right?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
I used to, but I stopped.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Where's the money?
I want him to think that.
He wants one.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
They're trying to come through the door!
What'd he say?
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
Here's your document, Sonny.
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
You're news, Sonny ...
Of course not ...
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
Who the hell is that?
What is it, Choco?
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
Okay.
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
<i>Did you get all four?</i>
Hello?
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
Cunt.
Cunt.
Really? Did you play in a band?
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
Many times.
Not really.
We're covered on legal with that, right?
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
I don't like anything else.
Talk to me.
I own a brownstone on this block.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Don't come back, either.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Jade.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Sal's gonna be mad.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Nice!
...peanuts.
Jade, you're late.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
It's a fucking shame.
ML stands for ML.  That's it.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Sal, can you do me a favor?
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
C'mon, Sal.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Keep it.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Hot.  Hot.
Shit!  I forgot.
How long then?
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
Why you gotta curse?
Tina, you're sweating.
Later for you.
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
I don't know.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
That's the dope.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
I didn't think so.
Take it easy, Pop.
No, I'm not it.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Excuse me.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
The name's Walter.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
No, it's a treasure map.
What?
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Who's Principal Collins?
H A R R Y...
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Your mom made a move on me.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
Nice jugs.
Can he do that?
I don't know. Owwww.
Owww.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
According to the map, we're just about at school.
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Hey, it's Jessica.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
What?
Sorry, Charlie.
I thought I told you to get lost.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Why ith dat newth?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
How was that?
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
I think you did it.
I'm not sure if I can do this.
I am strong!
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
It's the big potato.
Times two.
Knock knock.
You got the Extender?
So what do you keep in there?
Everything?
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
What papers?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Are you going to kill her?
This is horse?
My Lord!
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
What's that you're saying?
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
We have just folded space from Ix...
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
You know the ancient tongues?
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
Stop him yourself.
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Will we see a worm?
Always?
Why do they come?
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
What's in the box?
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
Did they try and fail?
Uh, beg to differ.
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
Let me take you to the hospital.
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
"It is my home."
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
What is this place?
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
You really think so?
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
It's a damn good role.
It takes me comfortable.
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
Dolores, wait!
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Mr. Wood?!
Yeah...?
I like to think so.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Tor, I should be getting home.
My eyes are killink me.
Can I help you?
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
OUR picture?
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Hello.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Those assholes.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
I thought this was a group effort.
B-but it's our money --
Why... yes.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
What do you love her or something?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
What?!
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
How you doing, Ed?
Yeah?!
Great line.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Mr. Pekurny.
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Are the TV people with you?
Hey, he cheated on her.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
Both.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
Who?
What happened?
Who?
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
What's going on over there?
Right, yeah --
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
What are you doing?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
Why do it?
I mean bad.
Oh my God.
What are you doing?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
I wish my stepfather was here.
So...?
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
There's a list.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
It's not their fault.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Come on, Ma.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
No -- keep it.
Who is it?
Check forging.
Can I help with anything?
Mm.
Ohhh...
How?
By the X.
Yo --
Tu
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
Mostly Tammy fans
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Plenty of pep, too.
So Tracy?
What's this?
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Hmm?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
Exactly when?
And how did you get in the school?
Yep.
What do you want, Jim?
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
Are you crazy?
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Who put you up to this?
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Yes, Paul?
Now could you leave me alone?
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
Did you talk to Exley?
I want to know about Exley.
Captain, what do you want?
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Why?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
Are you Pierce Patchett?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
No.
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
What's that for?
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
Really?  What did White say?
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
How about White?
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
When?
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Shut up!
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Brill?
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
I'll come straight there.
It is?
Yes.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
I don't know what that means.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
I'll pay you.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
I mean did you call anyone.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
That is one ugly sunrise.
Here?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
Drive.
Drive.
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
How?
Pretty fast.
Baudmore Consultants.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
About the accident.
Than why can't you tell me.
For your wife?
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
Have you been working with Rachel?
Sorry.
Stacy?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
I've seen it.
Oh, please--
I think you should leave now, Robert.
It wasn't me.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
Why the hell would I--
It is fish.
Do you like fish?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Other than Brill.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
I gotta go.
Rachel--
I've never met him?
This conversation's over.
Hey!
What's his name?
Gentlemen--
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
She can't talk to you right now.
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
Who won the fight?
Why don't you give 'em a call.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Are you okay?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Yeah.
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
Yes?
Now is that clear?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
Shall we be all right?
Do they know them?
Don't.
When were you least happy?
What else?
I can still taste you.
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
Why did he bring you?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
I'm sorry, Katharine.
A broken car?
Safe journey.
Have you seen Katharine?
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still…
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
How are you?
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Yeah, for a while.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Who are his ghosts?
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Oh.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
I can see my wife in that view.
This is Captain McGann.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
So I follow the wires?
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
No. But he hands them over.
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once… He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
Or my wife's.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
The windows don't open.
So he popped the pane?
Meaning--
We've got to catch him in the act.
You don't call, you don't write.
I have a question...
I don't want to waste your time.
Seems I am.
You're not taking me seriously.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
The Empress Death Mask.
I know.
We going somewhere?
But--
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
A film case.
What about your bags?
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
True enough.
Got it.
That's it. We're ready.
You bought this for me?
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
Won't take any time.
You were afraid of heights?
We're working.
You can't be too careful.
Ready?
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
What?
You've got everything planned.
Oh my god, I thought--
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
You shouldn't have.
But would you--would you--
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Four billion dollars.
Relax, don't jam it...
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
The door's the only way out!
--You're a cop.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
My friend, you always surprise me.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Where've you been?
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
Tony Marvin.
Whoa.  Remind me.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
Fax these to this number, okay?
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
The judge came up with a number.
I don't even know how much money that is.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
Then I don't get anything either.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
How many families we talking about here?
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
I like this case.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
Someone's following me.
What kind of truck?
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Why not?
Here what comes?
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
You've been reading for hours.
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Randy's mom said yes right away.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
You're around every afternoon?
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
You are someone.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
About this.
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
What time is it?
No, I need my car --
I'm embarrassed.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Where's my paycheck?
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
You're moving away?  When?
Soon, Lord Vader.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks at Han.
Barks his concern.
Barks at his master.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
That's right.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
Yes, Your Highness?
Not you?
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
You don't look angry.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
There's something out there!
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
Are you kidding?
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Get out of here, Lando!
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
What'd you say?
What?
The deflector shields are gone.
A tremor!
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
Where are you going?
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
I don't believe it.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
But tell me why ...
What's in there?
Ben?  Ben?
Will they die?
The Hoth System?
Yes, My Lord.
With food?
Go easy, Stevie.
Primitive?
Ooww!
Cuervo...?
Where is he?
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Shit.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
See you in hell, Snake.
Shut up, Plissken.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Defense against what?
Not you?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Where is it?
Later.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Well, I'll think it over.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Is he coming?
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
When you threw it in, what did you see?
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
What?!
A king must marry, after all.
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Guenevere...
Excalibur! Is it true?
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
And you cannot love me...
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
A lovestruck page!
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
You are truly magnificent!
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
The oath. You didn't say--
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
I'm sorry.
Hi
May I ask...?
Oh, I see.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Oh, she'd love it.
Thank you.
Rats?
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Lies?
We still think the temporal lobe...
Chris MacNeil?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Did he tell you about my party?
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Yes. He's already here.
What did you do today?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
We'll see when we get home okay.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Yeah
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
Karras.
I believe you.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Withering Heights.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
What's that?
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
And let my cry come unto thee.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
What is it?
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Who?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Are you comfortable Regan?
Who is it?
Is it Captain Howdy?
I'm afraid.
Give me the keys.
Frankie.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
So?
Well, look at this.
Honey ...
Honey ...
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Twenty years, Ma ...
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
Count it.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Cindy.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
Frank?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
What was it like?
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
You're getting cold feet about this.
Get out of here!
See anything?
Oh, brother.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
November.  '71.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
All night?
Why would I mind?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
How's it coming?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
Expensive hangover.
April.
They were simple songs.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
We're not getting paid then.
You don't know?
What channels it on?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Right.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Uh... he knows it.
This where the auditions are?
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
I wear a seven.
Shoes?
Right.
Fucking.
Jack, you with us?
Great?
Peggy Lee?
Oh yeah?
What's with you two?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
What's with you guys?
Some discussion.
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Is that important?
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
How come?
Brought it.
Thanks.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
They never do, Mr. Barker.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
All right.  Hold on.
Save it.  What's he look like?
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Fucking.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
Forget it.
He do that every year?
How's egghead?
I can keep the beat.
What's the matter?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
Soap convention.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Guess they're up.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
From Hurley's?
John.  It's good to see you.
You mean if I get sick?
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
Or reactivated the first one.
What do you mean?
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
For being one helluva guy.
I'm late for surgery.
No.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
What do you mean?
How is he?
You'll what?
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
I'm just having some fun.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What about me?
Just following your example.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
... That's great.
You're wearing your suit --
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
-- Yes.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Kate Reynolds...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Hello?
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
Why Jack?
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Where do I go now?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
What’s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
I’ve got kids, I’m going home...
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you’re okay?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
Why not?
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
She’s your dog, Jack.
Hello!
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
Excuse me?
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Our life in a nutshell...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Not it...?
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
You really are incredible...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
You’re so...beautiful...
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
It’s been interesting, that’s for sure.
I'm sorry...
So you’re not at a non- profit firm?
Don’t get on that plane!
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Peter Lassiter...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
Can I help you?
Last night was great...
I want to see you again.
I found it!
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
I'm not really dressed for a party.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
I can't take this.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
You got a chisel round here?
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He didn't.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What?
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Then what is it?
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Come on, Ben, come on...
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
Which was?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
It's just business.
What are you doing?
Victor, your scar --
You said it was urgent.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Okay to proceed.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
Trip? Where to?
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
Look at that...they're changing color...
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Thank you for saving my life.
But that isn't possible.
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
Looks like quite a way to go...
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
I don't believe that.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Yes, there is.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
The Wall's transparent...
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
Drop that fucking money!
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
Unguent.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
...Who's Jean?
...Blood has been shed.
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
Both of these.
How ya doin'?
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Uh-huh.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
You know what a disparity is?
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
...Yah, okay...
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
Yah, so we're all set.
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Well... yah.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Yah.
Shep said 8:30.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yah.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
You're darned tootin'!
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Hiya, Lou.
Where is everybody?
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
I'll fix ya some eggs.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
No, that's okay.
Yah, that's me.
Yah - how are you doon?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
...What can I get ya?
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
So... they didn't...
And this guy is...
Gustafson's accountant.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Copy.
Hon?
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Your mallard?
I love you, Margie.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
That wouldn't interest you.
What... ?
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
You are a moron.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Cornelius!  How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
No.  I found something new.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
Is that your blood?
Hmm?
The dynamite...
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
We need to talk.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
I'll take the parasites.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
In case we want to switch nights.
I'm just on my way out...
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
No, thanks.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
I don't know.
Say my name.
Say my name!  What's my name!?
I'm sorry, I...
What?
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
My God, you're shot...
Hello?
You were in here last Thursday night.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
What?
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
I guess so.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Don't I?
Yeah.
Thank you.
A nice, big cock.
Go ahead.  Say it.
But a good strange.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
What?
Alive or dead?
Hemingway.  You?
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
Okay... Ghandi.
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
... Marla ... ?
What... ?
I asked you what you studied.
I feel sick.
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
I want to hear the truth.
What are you talking about?
This conversation...
"Applicant?"
Why did you do that?
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
You took me to the house.
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
What a ridiculous thing to say.
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
Fuck you.
Ask me nicely.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Please...
Do something for me.
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Animals.
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
What list?
You have to tell us now.
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
No!  It can't be.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
You've made your point.
What?
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
What?
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
What is it?  What are you?
What is it?  What are you?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.  I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
"It?"
This place?!
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
No.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
I'll remove him.
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
You guys are real... aren't you?
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
What's that?
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
Gettin' old, huh?
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
You okay?
Batteries not included.
What's this?
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Roundeye.
That guy's not going to make it.
I'm getting him out.
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
And how'd you sneak up like that?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
Where?
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
Black.  No sugar.
What's up?
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
What's your name?
Hello, John.
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
Can I have my desk please.
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
He's not a moron.
I... You're not going to understand this.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
What do you think?
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
You're kidding!  What did he say?
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
Parry?
What if I was a relative?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
Can I help you?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
How un-sixties of you.
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
Please don't hurt me?
Have I died?
No... thanks... Listen --
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
The Little...
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Why did you do that?
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Happily married, probably.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
In a bar called Hellfire.
You a fag too?
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
Well, it's enough for me.
I don't drink coffee...
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Is it my turn again?
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
I know you're not.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
You like it?
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Okay, Ray...
Sure you don't want anything?
What's your name?
No substitutions.
No. We have tomatoes.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I don't make the rules.
I just can't look at you.
Oh.
No.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Yeah... I guess so...
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
With applesauce?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
It's none of your business!
You were going without saying goodbye?
But what about me?
What have you been doing since then?
Nothing.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
You don't call that music, though.
I have to talk to you.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
That's three games to none, Carl.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
I don't think that's true.
Well...
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
What?
Yo.
So watcha doin'?
You know somebody around here?
So you got a girl?
So what's her name?
That's it?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Who gives!
Wussup?
Why?
They are?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
I gotta go take a piss.
Like this?
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
What?
I wasn't asking.
Creasy, how old are you?
You're lucky.
Ask anybody.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Greetings, everyone.
Right.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
No idea at all?
My pleasure.
The two surfer boys?
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Here you are, Doctor.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
That's it.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
Cash. I'm impressed.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
It’s okay. The cops did it.
Why are they after you?
That's Brazil.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Alan Stanwyk.
Do you have a passport?
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Thanks.
Did you say cops?
My hero.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
She's cute as a button.
John who?
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
Are you still in love with Alan?
Thanks for the great time.
Who.
So?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
No.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
What is this....
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm terrified.
Don't worry, I can take it.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
You want I set up?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
Fletch.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
I have some ideas.
You'll have it.
Who's Frieda?
You don't know the Underhills?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
No thanks.  I carry my own.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
You going to be okay?
How'd you get this from her?
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I don't know, what was the case?
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
You okay?
Hello, Ford...
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Hey, they blew me.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
This way...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Ouch.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
It's me.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
What's fine?
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Jazz, we're talking here.
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
You'd said something about proof...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
'Bye, Johnny...
What?
What?
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Allo... Salvatore...
It has to be by the end of this week.
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
What's your story?
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
Des Moines.
That's in France.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Why not?
Yeah!
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Why not?
What about Sal?
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Pass.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
They around?
Why haven't they killed the juice?
You're shitting me!
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
You okay, man?
Frank...what's wrong?
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
Frank, we need to talk...
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
You ready?
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
Sorry 'bout that.
You call your son Little Chief?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
You just burned the desk.
That's impossible.
Dad...?
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
No wait, don't go!
What are you talking about?
What?
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
Dad, you there?  You okay?
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
Are you alright"?
Whatta you mean...
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Dad, what the hell is going on?
John, you there?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
John.  John, you all right?
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
What?
He ain't our guy, John.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
You used to be on the job?
No kiddin'?
Who are you?
No more... I can't!
Who brought up this bright idea?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Breakfast?
How about a roll in the hay?
Do you want a beer or not?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
Maybe we should do some exercise.
What's this?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
I don't know.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
Why did you come back here?
What happened that night?
In that little thing?
Faster!  Eat faster!
This is no time to celebrate!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
What?
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Darren, we better turn around.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Whaddya mean?
....with a woman's touch.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
What it is?
...And I said, shut up!
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
It's all over.
There...Ya happy?
Why?
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
Which is?
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
Anything else?
No, I --
Look, I don't want your money!
Maybe you should be moving on.
You're talking about my lady.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
That's very colorful, chief.
Does he know about what happened?
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
Oh, my dear God...
About Jessica.
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
No thanks.
That was truly excellent.
What's wrong?
Tell me.
Right.
But I thought...
Christ...where's Rennie??
What's that?
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
Did you find Rennie?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
I...I can't...
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
I...I don't know...
Rennie...
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
I opened thousands of brains.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
Don't talk like that.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Very dangerous.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Tonight. What's tonight?
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
What happened eighteen months ago?
That's awful.
You say we go?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
He carries a gun.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
She died.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Do you want to get some coffee?
Is it?
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
See, Daddy.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Alma Wetzel.
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
This could be it!
Where's your elastic brace?
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
How come you got the kid with you?
A grandmother. God bless you.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
This could be it!
They're my team.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Game six is history,pal.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Yes.
Yes, Peter.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Mine was cobalt blue.
You know what.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
Yes.
I am your wife.
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
What was he like?
And Jinnah?
Do you remember much of South Africa?
You've done me a great service.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
You mean a general strike?
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
No?  What's keeping you?
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
That's the last.
We don't have the manpower.
From what budget?
What are you waiting for?
Surely you know what you have.
We believe we have a suspect.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
You really need that much?
Let's get out of here.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
Call German.
We can't stay here.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
Hello?
I have your samples ready.
Where are you going?
Vincent...Vincent...
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
Why don't we say we were together?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
Where?
Does it have a name?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
I envy you, Jerome.
Of course I think about it every day.
What <i>is</i> this place?
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
You gotta be kidding.
All it takes is a long arm.
Hello, McCoy.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
That's your problem.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
What do you add up to here?
You want to drive?
Feel good?
Just like old times?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
You been okay?
That's not all of it.
It's just been a while.
Really?
You know how I feel?
A man helped me open it...
How long ago.
Texas is a big state.
There may be a hunting party.
What?
Only one car.
Where are you going?
Are you hungry?
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
No more about Beynon.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
I don't know.
So what?
You're crazy.
Where's home?
That certainly makes you kind of special...
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Hope you get to where you're going.
Yeah. I got out.
How's Mama and the kids?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Drive.
Which way?
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
I got a nurse in mind.
A couple of weeks back.
What's it got to do with you?
What about the brakes?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
That's not good enough.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Jack?
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Confidential, like.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
Where's he living these days?
Though nicer than most?
Could you do me a favour?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Who's setting you up in this place?
Is he coming here?
That's why you waited for me.
I want to give you an Oscar.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Oh, what you doing now?
That must be interesting.
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
See you later.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
It's not like that, luv.
You don't look it.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
And what you going to do?
I'll call the police.
You're a bastard.
Are you awake?
Are you tired?
You coming back?
Is he?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
What's it to you anyway?
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Jack! I didn't like that.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
What's that?
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They did.
And it's not right to the customers.
The nurses?
You build it!
You fucking build it!  Men come...
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Someone should rob the office.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Did you?
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
Dave.
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
...I thought that we were only talking...
Why?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
And why is that?
Can we get some coffee...?
I, you know, they should be insured.
Yes.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
They aren't?
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
They're inured to it.
Who used to say that?
I don't want to go to lunch.
Mmm.
Would you excuse us, please...?
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Mr. Levene...?
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
Shelly...
Yes.
...ah, fuck this...
Why?
Then put me on the board.
Of what?
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Can't do it.
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
What?
I...
Dave...
Shelly...!
They took the leads?
Just now.
Fuck her...
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
I'm sorry...?
Yeah.
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
I've got to talk to you.
I've got to talk to you...
Monday.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
What would have elapsed?
When did you write the check?
What is?
What's going on here?
What power?
The deal.
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
What?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
You just this morning...
We haven't got a lead...
What is this, your farewell speech?
You closed him yesterday.
Where are you going?
Yes.
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Do you like them?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Will you take me?
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
What took so long?
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
Yes, thank you.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
Bought at the airport.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Then why do you come to me?
Is Kay coming?
Goddamn bitch.
You would risk your life for strangers?
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
I understand...
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
Ready, Frankie.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
I never met them.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
Beautiful.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
The 'patrone' is here.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
He's not the same as when I met him.
Where's my wife?
If you need anything, just...
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
What was it, so I'll know.
Where's my brother?
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
What the hell are you talking about?
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Is he related to the witness?
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Kay.
Does it feel like a boy?
Where?
Why don't you sit down?
On a plane back to Sicily.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
There are still things I have to do.
Nothing is more important.
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
Not good.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I know.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
We'll try.
On the phone?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
I accept your generosity...
This looks corny.
So what did you think?
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
Sure.  I loved it.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
What're you talking about?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
What have you done with him?
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
Or would you prefer a beer?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
I liked it.  We all did.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Very well put.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
That only leaves the rest.
Is that --?
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
I'm up.  Thanks.
Then take the pills.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Jimmy.  How are you?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
You remember what the doctor tells us.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
She is horrible.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
This is the studio where I paint.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
Then the rumors are true?
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
I was going to take a swim.
Mr....Kay?
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
A boost. A big boost ...
Who was the job for?
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
Get out of here, Ray --
Well, that certainly won't do.
I know you.
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
I'm on the move -
What's this -- ?
What's wrong with it -- ?
I guess ...
Got it ...
Diane 1.
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
You mean the poor --
Donny --
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
oh.
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
Sure -
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Nah. It's a scratch.
So what are you gonna do?
What happened to you?
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
He's gonna kill you -- !
You?
Shadow games ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
Come here --
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
What are we gonna do -- ?
He give you an advance -- ?
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
On account of Mitch?
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
Hey.
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
I go with you --
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Now... I'm in ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
You okay -- ?
What are you doing... ?
What -- ?
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
You need him...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
What about me?
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
You know what you got here?
What do you want, shithead?
Why don't you leave him alone?
What are you doing here, assface?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
What did you hear about that thing?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
I warned you a million times.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
What about the schools?
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
You want the melon?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
You know what to do?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
The third store down.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
When's the arraignment?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Who'd you call?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
How'd you know where to find me?
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Come on, Will...
Morgan, Let's go.
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
What'd you say about me?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
And what do you see?
What is it?
Where is it touching you?
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
No, there's a limit.
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
What's that?
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
What are you smiling at?
Thank you.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
So who won the bet?
Sean.
Good to see you.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
Yeah.
Why me?
My kind of background?
Seems like it's going well.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
--And confuse him--
He won't be a failure!
Hello, Sean.
Where're you going?
Well, she out did herself today...
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
That's very presumptuous.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Yeah, I read those.
What is?
How'd it go?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
They could see that I meant it.
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
Do you have a soul-mate?
They're all dead.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
I been there. I played my hand.
Yes.
Oh, I know.
Good for you. Congratulations.
I'll keep in touch.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Yeah?
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I really don't 'date' that much.
Yeah.
I want to meet them.
I've never seen your place.
When?
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
Want me to take a look?
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Yes, I do, Will.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Ready, Pa?
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
Ready, Ma?
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
Short fella. Pale face.
Want to work?
How many men?
Women?
Deputy sheriffs.
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Been out travelin' around?
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Is it fur?
They're all gone--or dead.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
Sure do.
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
Yeah.
I never asked you!
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
How about it, Ma?
Ma, you sick?
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
Got any more, Ma?
I ain't full.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
You mean get off my own land?
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
But what about this?
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
What's these?
Now you done it! You busted it!
Morning.
You do not.
You don't...
Oh... really?
You do not.
I want to be an actor.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
Jesus...
I just play my own collection.
Are you going to the reunion?
It's always the little things.
You look beautiful.
Do you want to get a drink first?
Is it something you've done?
...About five years now.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Say more.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Is that right?
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Hello, Bob.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They're not happy, sir.
In Detroit. This weekend.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Enough?
Don't forget your identity.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
I bought a new rug.
Debi's house.
Ten years. What happened!?
What the hell happened to you?
It didn't work out.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Doesn't matter.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
What?
You lived in Chicago?
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Ever think of moving there full time?
Just make yourself comfortable.
Show me again.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Oh, honey... What happened?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
No, you didn't.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Did he tell you that?
That's not true!
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
He's still sitting in that damn field.
You got everything you need?
I'll come.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Let's bring your bags inside.
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Great!
Yes. We're suing.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
What about Grace?
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
You've got to stop doing that?
How was the dinner?
What was I saying?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
Where to?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
They fired you?
What?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Ha...
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
Yeah?
Isn't it like, obvious?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
What, sweetheart?
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Long enough.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Secret Service!
Welcome to our show!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Shit!
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
One-handed!
Oh wow, we are fried.
Yeah?
And what's he do?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
What are you doing?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Shit! Come on!
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
I found it! I found it!
Crash Override.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
That's a nice score for a girl.
What the hell is going on?
I'm Crash Override.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
What?
How?
There they are!
You look good in a dress.
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
Good.
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
What?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Thank you.
Purpose of visit?
You're late.
What?
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
Brady!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
When did this happen?
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Found it.
Because the lights are all out.
We should call the fire department.
Now where are you going?
Yes.
Night Doc.
Who you calling?
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Come on Rachel.
Jamie, what happened?
Rachel come on.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
You look sharp. You understand?
You got your riot gun?
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
Its true, Sheriff.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
It's over.
Thank you.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
I know that Mr. Sayer.
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Probably Mister Riddle.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
I don't want to.
Want a beer?
Go get me a beer.
We're all alone, aren't we?
I gotta go.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
A man wouldn't do that...
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Okay. Later.
Hey, Laurie...
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
What about the rest of my comic books?
Who is it?
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
I'm not responsible, Sam.
I've given them his profile.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
If you say so.
I see.
It means... I see.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Hi.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Oh!
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
It's French, though.  It really is.
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
We could...we could do that.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Mm-hm.
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Yes, but you name names.
Yeah.
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
He's got like six gold records.
Isn't that beautiful?
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Elliot!
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
This is not an easy situation.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
I want one with you.
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
So?
Are you sure?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Oh, great.
Oh, yeah?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
This is the second opinion.
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
Hey!
Okay, okay.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Uh-huh.
Ohh?
Frederick didn't come with her.
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Sometimes she's terrific...
Ohh!
I know, no--  I know.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Good.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Good.  How are you?
I'd never do that.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Well...
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
No, the reason I ask is--
You're okay, though, huh?
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Why are you so upset?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I can't think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
A reward...
And?
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
It wasn't my day.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
...how are things at the Hospital?
Yes?
Why me?
...why?
That would adversely impact my income.
We could skip the Gavotte.
C'mon, pal.
You want to get married...?
You're ready now.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
How was America?
...are they hard to get?
Why did he come back?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
I like Popcorn...
Now, why in the world would he do that?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
..suitcase...locker...
...unmarked hundreds....
Look at this:
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
I'm an orphan.
Waited too long, hon...?  
My husband brought it to me from America.
You know it?
Of course, Commendatore...
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Darling...
...Franklin.
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
...might I make a suggestion...?
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Look what they put her on...
No.
...my love...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Ask me when we get home.
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Thank you.
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
What're they on about?
...I feel that...
She must be something special After Dark.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Then tell me.
Then what brings you back?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
...yes...?
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
No.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
Man, she's losing it...
Mine!
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
That would be a No.
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
...sorry...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling.

She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...

I don't believe it. I'm winning.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
So, are you a cheerleader?
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
All right.
Things are going to change, Earl.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
What are you doing?
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Good plan.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Mute!
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
What is this shit?
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
Do you take German?
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
Your son's dead and you love him.
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Turn that back on!
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
Come on, sit up.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
My name is Gina!
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
Look, Mother!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
Fruit.
Mummy!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
This.
What?
I shall call him Diello.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Mummy!
Isn't it beautiful!
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Skin cancer.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
I have my connections
What did you just say?
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
Never to put you in my will.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Do you know where you are?
Dreams?
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Last week...
It's not that kind of date.
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
He waited for you three hours!
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
I... I know that, John...
You were... very... inspiring.
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
That too.
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
Helluva story!
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Reporters don't have hormones?
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Hey, c'mon.
So where are all your toys?
Any particular brand?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
I found a cent!
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
Thank God.
Neil, calm down.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
Did you hear that?
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
Did the cleaning woman come?
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
God, your sister's really hot.
Neil, do you mind?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
You sure?
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Sing.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
I stood up first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
Your life.
Sometimes.
Why?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
I don't know.
Yes.
Why?
You didn't answer my question.
Is it?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
Where will you go now?
Be careful, Conner.
What now?
It has to be.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
How can that be?
Don't leave us, Conner.
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
I guess so.
Talley.
You get anything on Smith?
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Jen?  Are you all right?
The car.  All you want is the car?
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
Bullshit!
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
There is no way out.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
He needs a doctor.
What about my father?
We can take it with us.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
You have his address?
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
Are you out of your mind?
Can we talk some more when you get here?
I'm not gonna leave you!
What?
Kevin left without you.
Are civilians inside?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
That's enough.
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Louise?
Louise?
Sounds like you know the job.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
You want me to stick around, I could --
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Let it go, Captain.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
What's my name?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
I think so.
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
Are the disks still in your room?
Did you find the disks?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
Paul!
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
What is this about?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Please, I don't use guns.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
Anything. Strong.
I don't understand.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
The United Nations are still here.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
I will see what I can do.
Where are my supplies?
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
What do you mean, General?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
) You cannot kill them all.
Let’s go, Jock.
Very soon.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
Our cards, please.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Let's have dinner first.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
No.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
Has Roger spoken yet?
They are being evacuated.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
You could leave, Paul.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
What's the matter?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
It was substantial.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
What are you doing?
Where has all our beer gone?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
What are you playing here, Price?
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
I'm sorry --
Oh, really: who?
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Oh. Jesus.
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
-- closed.
What? Deep down inside?
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
Why not?
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
We can do it...
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
I was upstairs with Eddie --
What are you looking for?
Don't touch me!
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Jesus!
You think this is fucking funny??
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Rewind that.
Then who did??
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Ghosts killed your father?
And you think it's in there?
Excuse me?
Sara...?
Did you find something?
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
Well then who did?!
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Help me!  Please!!!
I want this one, daddy.
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Good night Angel...
To our family.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
But do you agree with me?
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
You don't think I know?
Maura, what is this!
Are you all right?
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
Maura.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Your daughter's been taken.
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
Where did you find this?
There's something in there.
There's something through that wall!
What do you mean?
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Something bad.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Why are you so interested?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Joey ... ?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
How do we start?
Really?
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
Looks like you've been expanding your...
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Cameras?
You got about five minutes and change.
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
We're going in from the ground floor.
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Don't you just hate kids...
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
Hudson, don't you understand...
Where did you get this?
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
I hope you know what....
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
If you do anything to my friend...
Something short.
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
-- and she's dynamite!
What a horrible little person.
You're from Muncie?!
...You know! For kids!
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Smitty.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
For Pete's sake, Norville!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
I filed it yesterday.
Muncie.
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
I got big ideas, though!
How long've you been down here?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
Awwww, buddy --
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
...Who let you in?
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
...education, were you?
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Finally.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
What's this?
I'd love to.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
The West Indies?
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
Where do you think you're going?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
I wish I hadn't heard --
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
Why was the maid crying?
I've never given it much thought.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
Well?
I wanted to help you.
I told you.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
Benjie!
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
I'm, uh, going to bed.
The turkey in?
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
Yeah, that one.
What's for dessert?
I have no idea.
Don't be dim.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
You've...
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
I'll drive you --
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
I'm fine dad.
Yeah?
Dad stop it!
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Talking to me, dad?
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
Thank you Janey.
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
I don't like coffee.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
Now you are being rude.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
What do you mean?
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Just be careful.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
Maybe you should have just a half.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Mikey?
It's freezing.
Want some gum?
You have to follow me?
You get in trouble?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
All my model planes.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
I love you.
Just after Leland Street.
I have to get back.
My partner...
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
It's legitimate.
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
What about your shoulder?
Sorry about...
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Forget your pager?
Good.
What happened at that signing?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
What do you want to talk about?
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Your friend's all business.
Will...I...
One of your cases?
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
I was her best friend.
You and Kay were like sisters?
It was like some big fucking secret!
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
Oh?
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Where's your back-up?
Wild card.
Your lips, they didn't move.
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
So you have the answers...
Then blame the one who made her...
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
I couldn't prevent it.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
And yet you knew what I would o.
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Laudanum!
I want more.
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Why does he call you that?
You want me to be a doll forever?
We're immortal. You've always known that.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Louis, look at me.
It can't be -
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
He can protect us, Claudia.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You really want to be with them?
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
Have you ever been caught?
Read her thoughts.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
We belong in hell.
Lestat - finish this -
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
It's only a siren...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
Well, what a lucky break for me.
How did you do that?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
You said the slave had a crucifix...
You can't look at them...
What about coffins?
You loved your wife, surely.
No... it can't end like that...
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
What can I do for you?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Stupid. Stupid.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Hello? Hello?
You get any sleep at all?
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Julie...
What do you mean?
I don't know...
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Ray, I can't...
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Voodoo.
You sure?
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Pretty cool bar.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Come on, it'll be fun.
Ahh, that feels great.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
You guys lost?
You stumbled into my hiding place.
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -— the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
He is exhausted.
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk ——	he staggered.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
We will see who is the first to die.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Good night, Oliver.
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
I felt he did not like me.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Thea, what's wrong?
Why in the world can't you?
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
Good morning, sir.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
What'd you say?
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
I . . .
A boy?
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Old college graduate now, huh?
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
She's swell.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Well then, how do you know?
George! George!
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Yes, you bet.
You want a martini?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
I know it's soon to talk about it.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
Got a match?
Oh, am I glad to see you.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
George.
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Some other time, George.
Hello.
When?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
With coconuts?
Well, why don't you say it?
Eighteen.
Too young or too old?
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
About what?
Where'd you get that dress?
No, I don't want to be rude.
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Hi.
Is it snowing?
Oh, George, George, George.
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
How about that one there?
You can?
For me...?
It's okay, it's okay....
Get on the rocks!
Maybe by now they are.
Your dad must be really pissed.
Where're we going?
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Coming up!  Give way!
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....
I don't know.
I thought you said she was going with us?
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Good morning!
Chief....
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
How long ago?
Mike's out there.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
Michael.
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
There is nothing to discuss.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
Do you?
Probably.
Listen -- what are you doing later?
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Where's my day book?
No.
What?
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
What're you going to do today?
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Are you serious?
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Can I go swimming?
Is that me?
Mike!  Are you going out?
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
It comes here from Cable Junction.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
I don't care.
He's got to help or it won't work.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
Go on, you're tired.
It hasn't adjusted.
Don't feel bad.
He's going with you, Doctor.
I'll need more men to look.
What do I do now?
It's romantic down here.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
And leave me down here???
Michael...
Fine piece of engineering.
Kathryn...
Change your mind?
I can use a shot of what he's got.
You want me to stay?
Recovering nicely.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
So?
What do you mean, we don't?
Somebody better get down there!
How is he?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
That's right.
Nobody told me.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
I'm sorry.
Like hell!
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
I like it when they wake up.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Some miss all their shots.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
He's big as a bloody bus!
He's a young one.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Musclehead?
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
So, you just get here?
'Course they're also so rich.
Sure am.
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Let's go, let's go!
I don't talk that way.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
No, South Georgia.
How far away is filter number four?
I'll go with you.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Gee, it's good to see you!
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Come on, sweetheart....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
It sure is good to be home....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Turn it off....
You knew...?
Where's my mother?
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
It'll grow on you.
You want to try your hand at something...?
All he did was kiss me....
Beginning of what?
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Michael!  This thing working?
They won't kill it....
That hurt....
We don't want any....
The fish.  Check it....
A big one....
Can I ride one sometime...?
I never....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
I almost forgot....
Sit down, Ma....
I want you to get out of the water....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
How are you doing?
Nothing out of the ordinary....
You could teach...You could....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Can you just go off...?
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
How can you just take the plane like this?
I can't....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
How do you like flying?
The kind with an umbrella in it....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
I'll get it back next time.
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
You the architect?
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
Hey!
They won't fight with me....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
Money is money....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When I invited you...
How long have you known Hoagie?
How long have you known Hoagie?
Bring her to starboard.
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
How come only me?
Shit....
Stop that!
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
Jake.
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
Did you bring it with you?
Who is who?
Not for me ..
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
You want my advice?
You gotta stop smoking ..
Because I dislike her too much ..
Where is everyone?
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
I haven't got it.
That isn't what you said before.
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
What exactly you doing, John?
Now?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
What if we need a back up?
What is that?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Did he get you the job?
Vehicle references.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Yes, Sir.
You must have some idea about him.
No.
The elevator wasn't working?
Did Amber have a dog?
What color was it?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
What are you reading?
No.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
Pray?
I know what you're like ..
Just your age.
I have to talk to you, Helena.
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
What does that mean?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
He's happy, darlin ..
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Now.
Oh Jerry.
No no...
Oh no.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Wonder what he said.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
That took guts.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Beer okay?
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
-- especially one like this.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
He's coming over.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
First you gotta tell me something.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
At last I find you.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
You love me now, don't you?
Rod --
What are you doing with me, Rod?
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
You are not allowed to act this way.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
You're telling me to dance.
What's wrong.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
I'm sorry I asked.
Jerry!  You made it --
Thanks for coming.
They do, my brother.
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
Her new boyfriend.
You look good.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Eric! Are you here?
Udesky.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
You had the phone the whole time?
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
How would you classify it?
We could co-write a paper.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
Know what this is?
How much of this island have you explored?
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
It matches the pictures.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
Resentful.
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
But he's the head of InGen!
Are you looking for a problem?
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I could come with you.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
What?
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
You version of it.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Then this is our chance.
I think she's with Sarah!
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
Can you set up?
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
Oh, God.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Where's Kelly?
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
They are?  I'll be damned.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Oh, shit.
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
Dr. Grant!
Do you see anything?
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
No.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
Faster, faster!
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
Straight-A brainiac!
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
I can't!  I'm scared!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
You're married?
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
I didn't say you were scared.
Oh my God!
Hey, we were saving that!
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
He left us!  He left us!
All night?
Go away!
Watch how it eats!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
What works?
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
Don't do that!
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Jesus Christ!
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
I think we're lost.
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
I don't know...
Two.
What?
What are the charges?
A house?
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Are you going to plead insanity?
You watch this garbage?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
How long will he need to be asleep?
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
You're not going to be there?
You saw him?
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
You know how to use one of those?
What's that?
Ten minutes...
Where do you live?
You look like brothers.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
I read the one about the penal colony.
You work in the cemetery.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
It's my last and final one.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
Was there something else?
Hello again.
What?
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
You almost married recently, didn't you?
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
... A piece of paper ...
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
Women are all you have on your mind!
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
Father!
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
Holy God! The mummy walks!
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
Where do I charter a boat?
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Give it back!
I tell you it doesn't exist!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Uh uh.
Guess!
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
A few more days. We know who did this.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
What about?
You said that.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Well do you think it was him?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
What?
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
That who?
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Well --
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
I know Tom Grunemann.
No.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Are you closing the case?
Does that distress you?
What do you like best about your daddy?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Show.
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
What about my orange juice?
You're late.
Okay...Same as usual...
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Yeah?
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
Salisbury steak.
Then eat around it.
See you in the morning light.
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
See.  That's my name.
Wow!
Mom--I mean, dad?
What don't you understand, pal?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Objection!
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
Was he unfaithful?
Were you?
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
I'm not taking him with me.
How's the new job?
He looks like a terrific kid.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Yes.
And?
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
And?
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
I lost him?  I lost him?
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
You ever see her talk to the walls?
Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You're on your own, understand?
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
You ever think about getting married again?
How many onions does it say to use?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
You heard anything yet?
Hey, that's terrific.
Huh.. .Hello?
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
Where will you keep them?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
With much bloodshed.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
I will be back in a few days.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
I need to squeeze this brain.
How big is Tibet's army?
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
What can I do? I am only a boy.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Has anyone died?
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
I am scared.
Did you ever doubt it?
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
They will take Lhasa next.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Good day.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
What does the butter spot feel like?
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
I have more men.
Things change, Kundun.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
No.
Much too young.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
I'll sue you.
You're a beautiful woman.
I might get a shot.
We are here on official business.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
Is this a trick?
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Was he a good man?
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
Where is he?!
At school they'd always say "go" first.
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
Where is he?
You take care.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
With crocodiles... everything's even.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
How big do the bears get?
Why are you here?  Really.
I'm not making it up.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
That was an awful thing to say to me.
Okay.  We're up at six.
He thinks they're what?
<u>Are</u> you okay?
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Like little children.  You okay?
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Calm down.
What?
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
We might as well pack.
He's mooing.
Well...
I'm ready when you are.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
If you get a safe shot...
He just came up screaming.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
I wouldn't.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
And this is how he came to the boat?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
Hey!!
They don't believe her.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
That's not what you came to say.
Hey.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Lecter said a lot of things.
What girl?
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
Are you finished?
What do you see, Starling?
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
No, I came because we need -
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
They all were.
A moth... How did you predict that?
The death of my father.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
No. Tell me why.
No.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
What...?
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
My God, you've grown up.
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
What?!
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
Mr Poe?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
Will you consider that?
My God, Alice.
One called Magua arrived.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
Who were these people?
Any powder?
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
My colors?
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
We're getting out of here just in time.
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
Go on!
That was a loud one wasn't it?
How's astronaut training?
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
What can we do?
We made it!
What's wrong with it?
Excuse me, sir...
Shut up, all of you.
I'm going inside.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
What the?...
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
I'm going to try to remove it.
Clear for pickup.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What is it?
What is it?
Don't spend all day down there.
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
You fucking well have to get 'em!
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
I hate these Southern shites.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
How long has he been in there, son?
We gotta get those guns.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
It must be this one.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Right, his leg's going now.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
That's it all done, we are off.
I hope this is the right move.
You what? What are you on about?
Tom, this is our case.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
You got it all?
I'll see ya.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
And that does include the amp?
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
Where did you get those from, a museum?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
How many wings have they got between them?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
--you're going to be on your own.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
You're dismissed, Private.
So you knew this young man before?
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
How's business?
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
A .45--
Just wondering.
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
You look good--
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
Suppose not.
350 pounds.
I never met her.
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
I got a pretty good guess.
Didn't have a father?
So how come you got into all this?
Dad--?
Are we going to ever see your father?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Hey, Mikey--
Mikey--
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Right.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Your mother was a saint.
Historic occasion, isn't it?
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
That so?
I haven't been out here for a while.
Morning, Hollis.
You thought any more about our murder?
I got an idea what happened.
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Steve called for you.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
He squeezed money out of you?
What about it?
Morning, Sheriff.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
Murdered him?
Field trip?
Nice-looking kid.
No--
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
How come you don't took familiar?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
Hello, L.A.
Nix.
You ever been married?
Take a look at this.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Hokey enough for you?
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
And are you afraid?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
He's a secretive man.
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
Are they treating you okay?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
They were jealous of him.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
So why did you marry him?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
What did you find?
What then?
What was that?
I've got to help him.
Is it finished?
What the fuck?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Are you finished with me?
They weren't worth a damn.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Whose is the car?
Any movie stars buried here?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Are you satisfied now?
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
Harry D'Amour.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
Oh Jeez.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
He did something with the ground.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Nix! Nix!
And?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
What about you? Why are you here?
What do you do?
Of course.
I know.
Do you ever see him?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
I'm sorry.
Why can't it last?
Charlotte?
Well... have a good flight.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Mr. Harris?
Evelyn Waugh?
How'd it go today?
See you later.
Do you think it's done?
Are you sure you want to stay?
I miss you.
John! What are you doing here?
I missed you.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
Yeah, like...
I found them in your file box.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
I can take care of myself.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
Is he going to be okay?
He spoke to you?
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
What do you mean?
And the point is?
What?!?!
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
I don't understand what's going on.
So what?
We needed to know all we could.
Nothing yet.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
You have to say that.
Plenty of time.
What can I do?
A lot of good that'll do.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
It's useless...look at him.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Good of you to stop by.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
What's this?
Parents died?
Ah, Mom.
I hate it.
nothing.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
So you're still breast-feeding?
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
What?
Coach...
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
That was nice.
Wait...
You could make a career by telling me where.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
So how long is this trip?
A horse?
I found you someone.
No.
This brother from my college.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
So how come you could play basketball?
I never knew a girl that could play.
Your Dad play?
I think we gotta kiss now.
So?
What?
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
You having fun?
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
What'd it say?
What?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
So how about a little one-on-one?
I...can't.
Sorry about your game.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Least she had time for me.
You don't think so?
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
So...how's the knee?
It just isn't.
So why'd you give up ball?
You asked me what was missing.
I heard enough.
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
I'll play you.
So?
With who?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
You hearing me?
How was your game?
Where's your dad?
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
Lucky kid.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Yeah.
No need for braces, Donnie.
You ok?
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Uh-huh.
...what the fuck is this...?
What the fuck do you want?
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
No.
About two years ago.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
Please, yes.
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
Well.
I lost my gun.
It's ok.
Just say no.
No, what's wrong?
What's your name?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
DAD --
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
I'm sick.
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
I paid you back.
What is that?
You don't need braces.
I don't know.
...ah...
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
Jack.
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
I think you have the wrong number.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I would just want to clear some things up:
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
the valley?
Are you close?
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Do you have your masters?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
It's not your given name, right?
They wouldn't?
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
What does it look like?
No I Said.
Marcie.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
Been drinkin' today?
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
You look great.
Willa Cather.
Come home soon after the show.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
That's it.
I don't.
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
...Jimmy...
No.
I'm Bob.
Want me to wake her up?
Was it a call back?
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Linda --
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
Hello.
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
Yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
Now.  You were saying?
But --
Aramis, this will never --
But --
Bloody hell...
Then to the Bastille.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
But why?
Coming?
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
It's been too long.
Thanks, but not for me.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
One for all.  All for one.
Are you hungry?
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
A personal nature?
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
... The ball... Continue.
Phillippe!
You dead yet?
What number did you tear out?
What number, on the first page?
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Magnificent valor...
... Nothing.
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
You mind if I ride with you?
We're by Ozone...
You can cut the shit, asshole--
Did you hit him?
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
What's this?
Alright, where is she?
Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
Are you alright?
Yeah?
What?  Wait a minute -
Something I don't already know?
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
What exactly did you see?
No, but I'm listening.
And what did you do?
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
No...
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
Are you going to be alright?
You must be going somewhere.
Are you a regular there?
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
What have we missed?
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Why not?
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
Who did he ask for?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Who is it?
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
You got the message Lecktor called...
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
There has to be.
That's why the boltcutter.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
I'll cover the back.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
Reba...
No. Reba...?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Can you read it to me?
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
I don't understand.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
To yourself...
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
If I were?
Molly?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
Can you quit?
Is Crawford going with you?
Hello.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Come home with me.
Maybe we should give it some time...
Let's forget who said what to whom...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Thanks for the lift.
Lt. Fisk said...
Will it keep them out?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
How did it happen?
Did you get my card?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
And?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
What disadvantage?
Do you have the file with you
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
Do you dream much, Will?
I don't have one right now.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Andy!
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
What was that all about?
I can't move my arm.
My hair is coming out.
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Five.
Right...
Popcorn?
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Have you told your family?
You're NOT DYING!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
It's so dirty.
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
Are you at peace with your family?
Goals are important.
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Why is he saying these things?!
Sure...
Bob.
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
A -- a tourist.
We'll need a search running.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
Do you?
You don't, do you?
There's something about him, isn't there?
He had an accident.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
Is that...?
Five.  Since I've been here.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
Hello?
Morpheus...
Holy fucking shit!
No!  It's too far away.
No way, no way, this is crazy.
Do you still want to meet?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
Why not?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
I thought it wasn't real.
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
And you still believe I'm the One?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Now left and that's it in front of you.
Tank.
You're the Oracle?
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
What's funny?
My name is Trinity.
That was a long time ago.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
And I know that's not where you want to be.
Uh-oh...
Get this thing out of me!
Is it?
Are you all right?
Go!
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
Holy shit!
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Know where he is?
What are your plans?
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
No, all we got is $40.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
No.
May God be with you.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Look at her.
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
So?
Nervous?
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
What happened to you Flash?
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
What do you mean?
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Shut up!
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
Back so soon.
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
I'm sleepy.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Don't count it...it's all there.
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
You mean it's heisted.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Just keep him quiet.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
How much?
That was 'Joe'.
I hate parties --
What, honey?
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
I wasn't going to say --
What about the Mayor?
Yeah, but --
And that?
What do you do that for?
What are you eating.
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Well... goodnight.
We have an arrangement now.
I didn't say.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Hot or cold.
Yes.
Who are we talking about?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
It's going to be great --
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
I'm all excited --
Sit down, Drew.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
What are their feelings?
Whose?
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
Well, I guess he's found one.
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
Yeah, that's what he said.
He was interested.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
What you then?
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Not time yet.
Don' be facety, woman.
Yah.
She knows how she feel.
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
Jennifer.
How long you here, Joe?
Thanks.
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
You think so?  How do you know?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Come again?
I've got plenty of friends.
She's in a great deal of pain.
Has her pain abated?
'To bed'?
...No.
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
Will it?
Did I say that?
The 'coffee shop' --
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
And what?
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
I want to live.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
Uh-huh.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
I'm not hungry.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Then what is it?
Which is what?
Joe, don't do this --
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Yes.
Yes.
You want me to be your guide --?
I didn't ask any question.
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
We're all here, Bill --
I hope so.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Do you love Drew?
Don't get carried away.
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Thank God.
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Where is he?
This is crazy --
I love you, Daddy --
Why?
79.
30.
Slam it?
Should I wear it?
You don't know?
Condition?
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
No, let's go.
Where'd you get it?
Do you remember me?
You think you can bargain with me?!
Is that what your little note says?
You know him?
Have I told you what this man did?				*
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
They treating you alright?
How do I know he did that to you?
His name was Jimmy.
What do the police think?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Why would you do that?
I'm not.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Yes.
Dying.
You tell me.
My name's Leonard.							 *
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
I'm not appealing the decision.
Shut your mouth!
Things change.
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
I don't think so.
We've got to get him out of here.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Unfinished business.
What sort of questions?
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
I didn't sell -
How'd you know I was in here?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
No, you won't.
You know, when we found your guy and			   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a			  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  * already dead.							 *
Why would I do that?						    *
* Thank you.							    *
Yeah.
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
They'll kill Gina.
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
You need to consider a few issues.
I don't know.
My end?
Make it 40%.
When?
What's "nothing"?
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Were you born in Havana?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Is it December?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Would you find me...?
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
No part of it wasn't real.
What...?
Yeah.
What friend?
What's our deal?
Stevens?
So?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Like...?
How much we looking for?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
Hey, fuck him.
What is going on...?!
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
Detective Crockett.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
That's right.
So what do you want?
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
C'mon, man!
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
You okay?
You sure?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
And...?
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
And as an investment in the future...
Then what were we talking to you for?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
What the hell did you do?
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
You ain't coming to work?
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
He's got taxi fare.
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Oh hell, forget it.
What for?
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
They wrong?
I'm scared.
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
These guys're good drivers.
Sounds like they knew you.
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
I'm going to Florida.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
You got it.
Sold. Let's go.
Getchmis olsun
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Twenty months?
Anybody bitten?
To what?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
Dad...I'm...
Where you staying, Dad?
DAD!
You know where they are?
Yes.  I think so.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Just what?
Got a family back there?
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
And you?
What they give you?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
Get the... midnight... express.
What?
What?
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Hishradyo.
Why the suit?
Never was anybody like you...
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Lady...
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Wait a minute-
Its muscles are locked.
You feel anything?
Is there a switch?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
He's special.
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
Do you think we did the right thing?
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Rub it on the windows!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
C'mon...
You sure you didn't see one of these?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Sure.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Here.
No, what is it?
I can take it, go ahead.
Pretty rough so far.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
You want me to burn my book?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
It'll only take a second.
What about a bee...?
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
Don't talk to me like that.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Newspapers?
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
I thought you were over it.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
You won.
Sort it all out.
A change of plans?
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Range is two kay.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
Do you know me?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
Hola..
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
-- his left jacket pocket.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
What did you think you were doing!
- you who don't have a conscience.
No.
What did you think of him?
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
'Terrorists?'
Excuse me?
And then what?
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Very.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Yes, I believe that's right.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
..I'm fine..and you?
It's the transponder.
Nekhorvich's boss?
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
Come on!
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
What kind of show.
You knew about Jim?
Satisfied?
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
You were in the car!
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
There was nobody on the bridge.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
Two cars.  Where are you?
No sir.
What?
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
On what?
It's quite out of the question.
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
What sector's the air conditioning?
Zero body count.
Claire.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Give me the God damn gum.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
I guess.
How was Chicago?
Where are you?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Jim...?
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
That's what we do isn't it?
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Try it again.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Cosmo?
You're welcome.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
Hi.  Hi.
You're not sleepy?
Johnny Cammareri.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
In a month.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
Here.
I got it done.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Why?
I like it well done.
I don't know.
No.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
I'm a wolf?
A bride without a head!
I can't believe what is happening.
I've got you.
What?
It's so bright.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Snap out of it!
I'm telling you you can't.
But that's cause he don't know!
They get some turnout for this stuff.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
I'm afraid of who I am.
Let me go home.
Ronny!
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
Bye, Aunt Rita.
You never have dessert.
Have Something.
Are you proposing marriage to me?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Yes, on the floor.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
Have you told her we're getting married?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
Will you live here?
And we'll sell the house.
How's the mother?
Did he tell her?
He's with his dying mother!
Do you love him, Loretta?
I know.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Don't make yourself sick.
Maybe I should go?
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
No idea.
Loretta...
Have you come to make peace with me?
I'm sure she did.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Yes.
Look.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Halt!  Who goes there?
You're using coconuts!
Where did you get the coconuts?
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Am I right?
King of the WHO?
Who are the Britons?
Well, how did you become king, then?
The same!
Oh!
All right!  What do you want?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
I'll do you for that.
I'm invincible!
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Nu!
They're nervous, sire.
There!  Look!
What?
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Look, you're a busy man ...
Oh, shut up.
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Yes, Lord.
Well?
Make a bridge out of her.
I feel fine.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Thanks very much.
They cost fifty pounds each!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Father, lad.
But I don't like her.
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
Until you, or anyone else ...
Well, look er, I ...
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
... I Bet you're gay.
They're all saying the word ...
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
You should have someone look after you.
The place is a mess.
Checked and locked, sir.
Hey, Barney.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
What do you know about the Highlands?
You sent for me.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
For Her Majesty.
So...?
She'll never understand it.
And the pony?
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
What is it, John?  John?
I was told you were in a fight.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
What's her excuse this time?
Erysipelas.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Has he been hurt?
How long has he been this sick?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Does that thing work?
What do you mean?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Nick...
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
It turned itself back on, Nick.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
Change the channel!
The Police, then...
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
What are you looking for?
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
Okay.  It's West.
The clock's already ticking.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
Shit...
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
What is it?
So tell me you're okay, then.
It's the wrong way!
It's here!!!
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
So how do I start?
Cool.
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
And?
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
What did I say?
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
Yes...what is it?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Wow!
You're really something Coco...thank you.
That's okay.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Hi.
No, no, I'm fine.
Betty.
Can you tell me what happened?
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
The money. You don't know where it came from?
Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
Okay.
"Really?"
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
I don't think...
Betty Elms.
You're so easy.
Nice wallets.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Hardly.
No...
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
So what do we do ?
McCay knows ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
So why this ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
That was eleven years ago.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
That was rather.... disappointing.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
How long till the drug wears off ?
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
Thank you very much.
The power went out in half the park.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Thank you, won't you come in ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Not now, Mom.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
What now ?
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Do you still teach?
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
You want me to move?
Okay, no problem.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
What does that mean?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Totally.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Thanks.
I told you it was a long story.
Special effects?
I know that.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Then what did she do?
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
I guess you have.
He's writing. Hello?
Hi there...can I help you?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Don't wake up Vada.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Vada.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
I think it's cool.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
...I dropped it.
Where are you going???
Never heard of her.
What's he smoking?
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
No?
What's that?
What's it for?
Well Rose was being very thorough.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
She lives here too?
Lock the door.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
So what's wrong?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
He's so tiny.
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Wanna play?
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Of what??
Danny?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
You are perfectly healthy.
They're dead?
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Kinda like men.
Yeah.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
I haven't danced in.....
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Vada, we're trying to work here.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
When?
Yes..
Hi Vada.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
I found this.
In the garage.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
No, no no....
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Sure.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
I paid the money.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
Maybe black means you're happy?
Hi.
Big Ringo fan.
I would.
Sure.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
NO!
I'm hemorrhaging.
Goodnight.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Your lip bleeding?
Hey look at this!
Bed wetter!
Got it!
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Get up!?
I do, she's real funny.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
I dunno..
Well when you get older, you just have to.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
You flew all the way h...
I was devastated.
Zit cream?
You're going to say it, aren't you?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
What else did he tell you...
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
About Michael's job.
But he always says...
He'll see right through it.
Uh, Kimmy...?
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
I think he's been fired.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
You never eat when you're despondent.
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Where did we first hear th...
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
I'm up against a deadline.
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
Does that make it right...
What's up?
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
You got the money?
Winifred.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
You have to what?
I said, I've been real tired.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
You going today?
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
What do you really want?
She's fine.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
How much?
Bastard
President?
Where are you going?
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Did you see who that was?
Uh huh.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Wrecks.
We don't mess with accessories.
Parts.
What kind?
Mom?
I feel really good.
Fungus?
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Bye.
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Well, can you tell me why?
Hello.
Hello.
Oh?
Doesn't it have a name?
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
I knew when I first met you.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
You know who that is?
What time?
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Ah... Peter Finch.
Ryan O'Neal.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
What did you think then?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
By all means, knock yourself out.
Divine intervention.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
You ready, Donut?
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Was what worth it?
Says the United States of America.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
Yeah baby.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
Waitin' in the lounge.
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
It's gonna be beautiful.
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Yeah.
Want me to come?
Who's going to buy me a beer?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
'You Duff Anderson?
You a union man?
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
How 'you doing?
Don't say much, do you?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
And his age?
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Yes, aren't you?
My father's the preacher.
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
How about another beer?
Hell!
They must work on the section gang.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
How come you stay 'round here?
What d'you mean?
I wouldn't have let you.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Goin' to see my kid.
What's he like?
I'll have some coffee, please.
What d'you mean?
Everything you cook is good.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Don't, Duff.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
Hi.
Okay.
A whole lot, Frankie.
Like a home, for one thing.
Good-bye, Frankie.
'See ya.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
Want me to hold the light for you?
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Seems a little loose!
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Don't be too hard on him.
Hello.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
He's your son.
Now you stay put!
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
You're hurt...
What you lookin' for, mon?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
Easy...
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
Never heard of him.
What?
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Where the hell have you been?
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
You haven't got it?
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Hello, Case.
I know who you are.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
My God... these people are insane.
Shit...
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Like what?
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
What?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Anita!
Okay. That's bad.
Now this is cute.
Bridgework?
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Do you even know these kids?
That's your story!
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Better person than I.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Josie, you look Rufus.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
We followed your instructions.
He <u>has</u> to know...
Yes.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Coming...
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Taste it.
Uh-huh.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
We're here!  You sent for us!
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
Where are you going?
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
You two got a thing going, or what?
So, you live around here.
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
Who told you to choke up that way?
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
Are you nuts or something?
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Are you sure?
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
So, you feeling anything?
Any ghosts in here?
I feel like a jerk.
Anything?
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
Hi.
What's so funny?
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
I'll need to take her things.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
What?
Horseshit.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
Kristen, can you pull us out?
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
You're late.
Yes, tell us, Nancy.
This is nice.
That's what I know.
Stop blaming yourself.
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Nancy...
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
Somebody else is out here.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
C'mon.
Hi.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
And then I... right.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Coffee?
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Here we go.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Hi.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Okay -- fine.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Too complicated.
Busy tomorrow?
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Whoopsidaisies.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Cartwright.
You've got big feet.
Oh please sod off.
Can I stay a bit longer?
What?
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
Hi.
Well... how have you been?
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Excuse me.
What does it say?
He's bringing a girl?
No.  Not true...
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bella -- this is Anna.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Da Vinci?
Yes.  What do you think?
What happened?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Well, fire away.
Martin -- your customer.
Max.  This is Anna.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
Can I help you?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
What did she say?
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
Spike.
Maybe.
Spike!
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
And yet you suspect her.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Yes, Billy?
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Yeah?
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
That's it! We made it!
Welcome back.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
So long, kid.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Wait a minute...
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
I second the motion!
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
They must be up there!
Yeah, where we going?
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
What?
Did to me?
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
Giving up?
I'm busting outta this place.
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
You can come back later!
Gimme a cigarette!
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Gimme the ball!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
My turn.
Jesus God...
Oh, what's that?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
How are you feeling?
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
Yeah, buddy?
What's troubling ya, buddy?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
What are they?
Please follow me.
Yeah...
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
There they are!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Is he in an asylum?
Your grandmother?
May I see your boarding pass, please?
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
So, what's the story with your friend?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
You're sure...
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
I'm a liberal!
Smoking or non-smoking?
Damon Bradley...
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
Why can't you just tell me?
To the foot doctor.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
So.  You found him.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Yes.  I am.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
There's no such thing.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Very funny.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Faith, this is my mother.
So, what are we waiting for?
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
Is everything okay?
But somebody wrote those songs.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
No.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
But what?
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
Have you seen him with someone?
It's a miracle.
I have vacation time coming to me.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Now what do we do?
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
What are you doing?
So?
Ah ha!...
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Whatareyoudoing?!
And he is living proof.
So...
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
She what?!
Where is she?
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
Well, where are they?
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready— remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens— This bum Wilson he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark! – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
See! You don't understand!
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work— with all them muscles. 
They play pretty rough.
In braids? That's right.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What's that?
What?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
The Golden Warriors.
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Wham... .
Were you really a prize fighter?
Now what are you doing?
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
And if you don't?
I— I'd like to, Edie, but—  —there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says—
You're not sore at me?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Pigeons... .
Terry— what's happening to you?
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
Edie.
My pigeons... .
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
What did you say?
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
Nice fellows.
What do you think?
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys— 
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
You was a Golden Warrior.
Give me a double.
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Something's making that music.
I am--It's our only chance.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
You're talking nonsense.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
You love me then?
But they are not yet one of us.
She was?
I understand, Master
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Your pleasures of course!
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Then it is some service you desire of us.
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
What're you talking about?
Lie face down on the floor.
Yes.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
Why not?
But you spoke to him on the phone.
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Ask him his name.
Adele?  You in there?
You say you perform in the Miami area?
I'm not dressed.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Where in the hell are we?
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
Jack?
Nice disguise.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
Outside of that.
How long you talk to her?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
What'd you talk about?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Shut up.
Sure, Daniel.
Leave it where it is.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Ironic, isn't it?
Who?
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
Karen, I told you not to--
How much for your company at chow?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Why, are you famous?
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
How'd you get this number?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Unless you wanna tell me.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Is that how you think of yourself?
A girl.
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
You like taking risks.
You really wear that suit.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Whose blood you got all over you?
I thought you guys were busted.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
The fish?
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Take the next exit.
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Why's that?
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
Flyweight.
You're not my type.
That's not Maurice?
Here?  In this house?
Thanks, Dad.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Technically.  They're separated.
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
Was it Foley?
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
You gonna go get him?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
Nervous?
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
How could you do this?
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
Get me into a plane!
It's shorter than our practice runway.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
How's everything?
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
How often you fight like this?
Danny's not coming?
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
What else can we do?
Rafe --
It must of been a convincing letter.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
I have'na been able ta --
Hello, Lilla!
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy—five? Eighty?
Do you believe in all of that?
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Where is it?
I don't get it.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
And we're here on the couch...
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Oh, Charlie.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Come back to me.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Are you for real?
Terry! Slow down.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
You think so?
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Damn that Charlie I
Thank God for that.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
Oh no!
Oh, you're both so naive.
I have a note.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
What happened to you?
Maddy's party.
I'm not the maid!
Would they go over my girdle or under?
I remember that dress.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
You look exactly the same.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life—styles.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
What will they be made of?
Will you take of f your blouse?
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
What happened to you?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Who was that?
What are you talking about?
All set?
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Zowie...
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
I gotta go back and do my chores...
You ever think about running away?
I know, Mom.
Allright. Calm down.
What was the file name?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
This time. What about next time?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Thanks, you guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
Jerk... What did you say?
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
I'm not going to die.
I'm not ready to die.
I'm ready...
Whatever.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
PARRTYY!
What do you want?
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
I know a good probate lawyer.
Opera?
Except... you were gay?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Hello?
What's Dr. Gillman say?
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
We're going to draw blood.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Good school. What year?
Great.
Lots.
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Now that you mention it...
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Not when I was in the Navy.
Going on... like...?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
How many you see?
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
There....
How many bottles?
S'matter?
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
So now you know.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
He can pilot?
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
Smoke screen for what?
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
This does not help us, Johns.
We cannot go through there....
Well? Is it just the pump?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Fry?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
And pointless.
"God is Great," yes?
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
We crossed our own tracks.
...then we saw this.
Very big beads.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
Take it.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
I apologize.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
The best. But we won't need them.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
You didn't think so then.
'I am not a missing link.'
Got your sensors?
No.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
This place is dirty, doctor.
Hmph.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Objection!
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
All right --
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Can we take a dip?
I want her.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Who put them up?
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
How so?
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Stop right there.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Of course.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Are you going to take her with you?
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
I SHIT on all o' you.
Sarge?
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
You lame Taylor?
I was wrong.
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
Where's Lerner?
Feel good?
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
Indefinitely?
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
What's the matter?
I think I'd like to dance.
They might think I was running away from something.
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
Dance?
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Cold?
Why not?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Then he's got to be a detective.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Anything I can do about it?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
See anything?
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Mine?
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Me?
Yes, Miss.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
I expected nothing else.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Private eye?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Who told you my name?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
A little something on account perhaps?
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
Got a moment, Inspector?
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
I don't understand.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
I have a rough idea.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
How's Mary?
Committed to memory.  Forever.
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Oh yes?
Why not stay?
Me too.
You don't trust me.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
Not yet you know any of these people?
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
Hold those rights.
Still in love?
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
Hello.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Hello, Jimmy.
So how is she?
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
Ever done this before?
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Where's Roach?
Why should I?
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
What?
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Sorry.
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Johnny, it's the only way.
Time for lunch.
The hell are they?!
What do you want?
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
This gonna take long?
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Look at you.
Ouch.
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
Why us?
What story did you give to Davis?
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
What's he got?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
You don't know anything about me.
Congratulations, sir.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Mr. Harris.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
New York.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
You're joking.
What's your name, lover.
Get in.  This side.
Better believe it.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Let's talk some more first.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
No?  Why's that?
I buy companies.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
By breaking up a company's assets --
Vivian --
It'd cost you.
Four thousand.
But you want days too.
I'm sorry.
You liked the guy, though.
Why not?
Was someone rude to you?
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
Fuck off.
Edward, I can't.
What if someone tries to steal it?
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
What time's diner tonight?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Why do you want to know?
You're being ridiculous.
I don't think there's any sense in --
You broke my nose.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Looks slow tonight.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
What kind of school?
Couple a hours.
Yeah, what?
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
What's your name?
I got a dress.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Are you looking for something in particular?
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
Till they kill you. Yeah.
You don't believe me?
My Westley will always come for me.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
You mock my pain!
Does it bother you to hear?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
I only dog paddle.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Probably he means no harm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
The Man in Black?
Inigo.
I brought you a special present.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
Now?
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
How old were you?
There's something I ought to tell you.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
You are sick, that's why he's here.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
What is that?  A handkerchief?
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
Help!
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
I'm not going to jump on you!
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
Vaaaat???
Always.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Get car.  Get car.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Like clockwork.
Hindenburg...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
You out to buy a motel?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
No.
No! Of all...
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
No. I told you, she's confined...
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Yes.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Did he say anything about my sister?
Yes?
I'm Mary's sister.
Is something wrong?
Here?
What thing?
What thing could we be in together?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
Where... can I stay?
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
He didn't come back here?
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
What?
What is it?
You can't go up there.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
We could laze around here a while longer.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I've caused you some trouble.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
A man should have a hobby.
Why do you ask that?
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
She sounded strong...
Why don't you go away?
No, not like me.
You slept here all night?
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
I'll get your bags.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
You didn't find anything.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
How do you do.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
What is it?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
But I think these things are beautiful.
But it was really my fault.
What! What are you talking about?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
Why?
Oh, is that what caused it?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
I'd know him anywhere.
Two: what if I didn't miss?
What?
Why am I doing this?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
Dysfunctional --
Why?
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
They're filthy, Mother.
I know, Mother.
But who were they?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Don't mention it.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
I do, too!
Of course not!
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
What do you think, Brother?
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Yeah.
There goes Mother.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
No, Mother, he's lying...
What's happening?
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Are they polar bears, too?
Is her husband sick or something?
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
I am ahead of you.
Please do.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Well, she's back.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Boys? You say to me boys?
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
How is she?
It's twenty after one.
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Is anything wrong?
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
I got an awful bad cold.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Well, it was a silly question.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Yes, dear, what is it?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
And... ?
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
Sons of bitches!
No offices are gonna be open today.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Wh... what... ?!
That's sick.
When you planning to cut back on that?
The booze.
What about him?
They... they shot me.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
What's mine say?
No, we're stealing.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
He tried to kill us.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
I'm gonna get beside him.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
What... ?  Not you too?
You need a doctor.
You get him?
Been waiting long?
Get his attention.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
I don't think so.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
There's still good in him.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Yes, my Master.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
I have felt him, my Master.
Are you all right?
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Hey!
Someone who loves you.
What's going on?
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
Good luck.
What did he say?
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
What's he saying?
Over there! Two more of them!
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Come with me.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
I was telling the truth.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
He might be.  I don't know.
I'm coming with you.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Brad...
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
On the day I went away.
I think you had better both come inside.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
...How's the turtle food this week?
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
What's funny?
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
It's only temporary.
They're all the same.
...What?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
...I dunno.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
...Like you?
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
...Paulie. Stop now!
Owe you what?
He won't last one round.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
He got lucky.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
...That's an old one.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Seven minutes!
Here -- Three minutes.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
I say ya nothin'!
Yo' yellow, old man.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Did you hear what I said?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Makes your breath like garbage.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
...What?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
...Who'd ya fight?
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Did ya get the message, kid?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
...What?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Don't you care what the people will say?
Ya nose is broke.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
How I look out there, Mick?
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
It don't matter.
I'll do okay.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
You ballin' her?
Outta my house I want ya!!
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
Is this paper even good?
What was <u>that</u>?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
So where is it?
Hold on a second.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
When will I hear from you?
Valiant!  You surprised me.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
You tricked me, damn you!
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
How do you know that?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
No, kid, you're a real hero.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Farewell, my cuz.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Do you have it?
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Well I don't!
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
Not to me, you know that.
What in bloody hell is going on?
From Interpol?
Lose them!
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
I'm a patriate.
Are you alright?
Where's the case?
Do you have it?
And more importantly --
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Whoever hired us.
Then where is it?
Gregor, is that you?
A means to an end, is that it?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
He sees this differently, as you well know.
So what is it you want to know?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
I ride with fat-boy...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Cigarette?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
It was at that.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Clearly.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
You have to stop doing that!
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
What's the story?
Gaelic.
Why's that?
My man, how you doing?
Can you get it?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Don't spend it all in one place.
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
We don't know that.
That's right!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Not bad enough to kill him.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
Well, I don't know...
Whoa, Earl!
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
What's wrong?
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
A satellite dish?
How are we going to do all this?
Why does that bother you?
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Test the product?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
I don't know.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
Yeah.
Anything I can help you with?
C?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
A lot of men come in here?
Why?
About what?
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Hey where's the hot pad?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
What are you saying?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
You'd do this to me?!
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
Don't you want it?
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
You think he skipped town?
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner six!
Two-hundred thousand!
Invitation, please.
Wait.
I got my sources.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
So tell me what you know.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Oh, you American?
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Carter, get off that stage!
I'm sorry.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
What'd I say?
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
You lied to me.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Well, hurry up.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
Where are you going?
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
You're not very good at this, are you?
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
No, no, that would be crazy --
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
It's a long story.
Slow down, baby.
I don't want to hear this.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
Pick it up!
Let me see it again?
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
Very nice.
What is Mac out?
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Lee!
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
First class.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Is this a payoff?
You move well.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
Lee!  It's him!
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
He stole my wheel!
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
You make the plate?
The license!  You get it?!
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
What?
You talk too fast.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Excuse me?
What?!
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Oh no, I dropped it.
What are you doing here?
Oh no.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Œem.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
I'm talking about the girl.
What kind of assignment is that?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
You sonuvabitch.
My daughter.
Hello.
I am so sorry about your men.
I will not have friends in America.
I'm not running.
Ahh.
You look awful.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
"Nothing but net."
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Or a vegetarian?
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
In vino veritas.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
I have no idea what I'm doing.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Thanks.
I think you'd look good in red.
It's nice that they're still friends.
They made me put my hat back on.
Getting nervous?
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Maybe someday.
I don't know.
I'll have the same.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
It's fun!  It's high.
Yes I do!
To who?  Are you asking me?
Yes, I did.
You're a goddess!
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
But I'm weird.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
What happened at the luau?
You okay?  I'm closing.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
I hate boats.
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Even when you were young?
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Who is it?
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
About forever.
Walter.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
You told a lie and got on a plane.
This is a photo of hair.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
It's probably just the flowers --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Sure you do.
Hi.
Why not?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
Why not?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
No.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
You'll find out.
Not.
How did they get our phone number?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
It was sinking.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Bye bye blackbird.
Dad!
It's a sign.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Jonah!
Don't ever do that again.
Everyone at work heard you.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
What's wrong with Annie?
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
Hi.
You saw her in the airport and then here?
It's a little derivative.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
You look good.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
It takes time --
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Who? A scab?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Forget it.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Was it expensive, the beer?
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Luís! Come down here!
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
Ramón ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
How far out of town?
He knows where I work.
Really, I don't want to.
Colette, go.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
Where to?
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
What?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
You want a hit?
Can I ask you something?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
Can we talk price?
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
You want to do this some other time?
Come on, guys ...
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
Shoot him.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
What?
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
What the hell are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
Jimmy?
What's on the other end of this thing?
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
You're lucky, Flynne.
Nervous?
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
My sentiments exactly.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Report.
Yes, sir.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
A private, sir?
So, where are you from?
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
Yep.
That must be four thousand yards.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
What do you think?
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
We left them eighty-eights.
Watching.
It's worth it.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
It looks like a Renoir.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
I wonder where they're going.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
What'd you say, Captain?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Fresh out.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
How about...?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
You alright?
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
And how do you bluff yourself?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Huh?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
I'd like to go, sir.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Yes, Private.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Shit, sir.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
Pardon me?
No, no he's not.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
You're tough, J-man.
C'mon, just do it.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I can put that together.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
You like it?
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Which they did.  Let me finish.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Actually, I think that I...
Well...
I'll go.
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Sure I do.
So what's your job this summer?
Yeah.
I think you should wear that.
Oh.
Won't you see me later?
Me?  Sure I do.
Yeah.  With potential.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Okay, this is important...
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
Well, I need to study, and...
We'll see.
Did you talk to Corey?
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
How's it going?
What?
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
I know
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
Just her name.
My car.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
Certainly.
I love you man.
Luck.
What?
Should I stay?
All right, okay, let's talk.
We started without you.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
Scherner told me something else about you.
When?
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
You're not telling me something.
What's that?
This is not my problem.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
How many?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Oskar, good of you to come.
Thank you.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
That'd be fine.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Don't ever do that to me again.
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
I got to go, I'll see you.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
Eight hundred, give or take.
That's very generous of you.
We need to talk.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Shit.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
WHAAAATT?
It helped me realize one thing.
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
I couldn’t believe you didn’t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
Jesus, you’re just as whacked as your son.
What are you going to do?
Why?
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
And now, drum roll please...
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Yeah?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Dewey?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
I don't play games.
Oh--a God complex
What do you mean?
You're getting obvious.
No, wait...
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Who is that guy?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
How many guys they have on you?
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
..it's really about family and tradition...
Hello?
She's not here right now.
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
What was that?
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Jesus.  Hello?
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Nope.
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
Please, call me Gale.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Hmm.
Oh yeah, how?
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Is that a threat, Detective?
Detective Kincaid?
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Where's Gale?
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Jennifer needs me.
Stop following me.
You're not a detective.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
What's your point?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Geez.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Just because you knew her?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Gale he's got Dewey!
Who's this?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Owwww...
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Ready?
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
Hello.
What?
Hello.
I don't think so.
Just some scary movie.
Uh-huh.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
What did you say?
I have to go now.
Gotta go.
What do you want?
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
So you better leave.
Where are you?
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
So is Dewey your real name?
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
I'll call for backup.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
At the airport.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
You girls ready.
Have they found my father?
Drive by patrol.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
That fish smelled strong.
Where is she?
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
You owe my mother.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
Where do you get this shit?
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Can you see me right now?
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
Have a good trip.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
Jesus, this place is packed.
So what's his reason?
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Do you really think Billy did it?
Come on, Sid.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Who?
No way.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
I thought you dumped her for me.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
What do you think?
You've left unfinished business before.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
I... I don't follow.
Who said this was murder?
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
It's too soon for him.
How's that?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
No witnesses of any kind?
What the fuck is that?
What?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
Does this make it with you?
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
We don't know for sure...
Well, that was money well spent.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
So they ran our list.
How do you know all about this?
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
Think about it...
You stupid son of a...
What are you talking about?
He's preaching.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Where's the victory?
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
You knew I'd say yes.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Well... what the fuck, man?
Put your gun down!!
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
But Mose Harper said...
Let's get along...
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
Unnt-meah!
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
I've come now...
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
How'd you come by this?
Talk!
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
What you want me to call you?
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
And you think we got a chance to find her?
That don't make 'em kin...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Think she means for us to follow?
I think maybe we oughta...
Ethan, quit it!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
No...She's not...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
She'd be about thirteen now...
But couldn't you...?
Why else?
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
I mean the armchair!
I miss Tommi so much.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Martin, what-
Ellen.
I really hate to bother him, but...
Hello.  Can I help you?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
You didn't tell her!
You are a gentleman.
Follow that boat!
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Thank you, my lady!
Tomorrow.
Never!
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
A woman of property?
by order of the Master of the Revels!
So what do we do?
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
God be praised!  Locked?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Where are you going?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
Nobody. The author.
How will it?
Kit
Wonderful, wonderful.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
The daughter of his enemy.
God bless you!
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
Will!
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Oh but why "alas?"
You can bring them with a word.
Can you love a fool?
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Even your play.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Oh, Will!
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
Will you read it for me?
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
Take off your hat.
Where did you learn how to do that?
And her voice? Like lark song?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
He's still here.
I can't do it.
Don't you worry about that.
How much did you pay?
What is this?
What's all this for, more security?
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
You looking for me?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
What?
Well?
Well, is it?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
What?
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Well, she had problems --
The man we know and love.
David hasn't seen him either.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
I don't thinkI can.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Be careful.
Stop nagging.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Later. But first -- him.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
We could put it somewhere.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
What?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
You mustn't take it so badly.
So, uh...
It's OK. There's no problem.
Can you afford this place?
Downstairs.
Is this where no one stays?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
You get the job done.
Would you like to come in?
I see.
Do you think you could answer that?
I write about it?
Yes.
Diseases.
I thought you were in a good mood.
Don't you like her?
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
Lester.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I know.
Wow.
Nummers.
No, I know.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
She what?
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Oh, no.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Then it's not your problem.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Shit.
Chopped liver?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
Well, are you?
No kidding.
No shit.
Yeah.
Right now?
You do know what money's like these days.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
George!
How long you had this?
-- Well no. It never came up.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
Jill's coming with us.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
No.
George...
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
George... how about Felicia?
Baby...
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
-- sure.
-- where'd you go?
What's wrong?
-- good afternoon --
I've got to leave?
Where are you going?
Look about last night --
What with?
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
You're different.
Honey?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
George?
When can I talk to you?
Egypt.
What do you want?
When?
Jill says nothing.
What does he direct besides traffic?
Television or movies?
I don't want to fight, George.
Yes.
Baby, please don't... I love you.
George...
Stop it.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
What're you here for?
Said what!
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
It's good you want to do something, George.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
You live like a pig.
All night.
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
What took you so long?
Awww --
You're home.
No you won't.
Sid.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
They get hair all over the place.
Jackie Shawn.
Hi, Leonard.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Well, what is it, honey?
It must be something.
-- Yeah, honey...
What?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- Yesss?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Good for you.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- why?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
We'll let you know tomorrow.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Yes.
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Room 237?
Yeah.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Because he hides.
What sort of injury did he have?
Sure.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
No, we don't mind.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
It's good to see you.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
What do you want me to do about it?
Did you find anything?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Get him out of here?
I...
I just want to go back to my room.
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
can of itself be a problem.
Well, obviously some people can be
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
Hi.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Lowe's car-?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Are you all right, Marty?
There's something else scary.
Rattling. Rustling.
Mom-!
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Don't call me dear boy.
Your mom's not around, is she?
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Well... was it a prescription?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
It could have been anything, Marty.
I saw what I saw.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
Yeah? Really?
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
What if I say no?
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
But how?
He's... dreamy.  He's...
SING!
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
What?
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
You bastard!
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Two days.  An hour or so.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
What is it, Mary?
Jackpot!  Two buckets
Hurry, Sister!
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
What?
A cigarette?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
We need experience.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Mary Clarence!
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Mary Clarence!
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
You were unhappy?
The reason?
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
The vow of obedience.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
Is this all the food I get?
Yeah?
It never solves anything.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
You're my Olympic event.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
You sent for me?
So I don't shop.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
I am?
Really?  Lieutenant?
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
You're not... seeing anybody?
I've got to go.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
What're you doing?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Where's who?
We're looking for Mike.
But you didn't tell me!
And if she runs?
It's done?
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
Well?
Right.
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
There she is!
What's she doing?
It should be here any minute.
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
An... entertainer?
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
I don't understand.  Where is she?
Reverend Mother?
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
What the hell are you doing?
They spend two days in chains.
No bleeding.
We must be a curious sight to him.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
Thank you.
We are leaving.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
What now?
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
You promised justice.
And this gives worth to butchery?
What are you doing?
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
What is so urgent?
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
I have not been able to face him yet.
The church.
Quickly, close it.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
Returning to the Western Woods?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
You... you are alive.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Did you decide, sir?
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
Don't you live somewhere?
Did you want to play ball with us?
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Well, I hate him.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Oh, jackin' off?
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
Why not? It died?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Huh?
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
I'll be.
You scared me.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Thank ye.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
What brings you back?
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
Okay.
He just got out of the state hospital.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
Where will he go?
Will he be supervised?
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
And your father? Is he from New York?
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
What happened?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
What'll it be, Auggie?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
How'd you get started?
They're all the same.
What do you mean?
Hey, man, good to see you.
So what did he say when he called?
So. Are we ready?
Every word.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
What do you mean?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
So you're just going to give up and go home?
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
And you're giving it to me?
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
There's just one thing I want to know.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Lovely.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
It's for you.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
So I can get my job back.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
I just want to know where he is.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
No thank you.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
And have you mended them?
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
Eight-thirty.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Appreciation for what?
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
And?
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Good thinking.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
It is.
Now, Mister Gi...
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
You don't believe in God anymore.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Yes.  Initially.
I did.  Boy.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
Does it now?
I believe so.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Are these your bags?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
We're not?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
With me?
Nellie told us about it.
You mean it's a girls' band?
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
I think they got me.
You don't see any blood?
Where are we running, Joe?
My name is Josephine.
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
This way, Daphne.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Good night, Daphne.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
Me?  After Sugar?
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
And where's he going to be?
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
What are you doing with my flowers?
WHAT?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
I'll say there is!
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
Not that, you idiot.
Sugar?
What'll I tell him?
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
She sings, too.
We'll take a rain check.
Good night, Sugar.
Oh - Sugar!
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
I'm a very sick girl.
Who needs vermouth?
And bring the cocktail shaker.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
What do you think you're doing?
Yeah - Josephine.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
I always did.
Thirty-four.
How did those holes get there?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
What's wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
We can have it altered.
It doesn't matter.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
We got time off for good behavior.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Put it here.
You can't trust those guys.
That so?
You don't say?
Men!
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
You're not hurt, are you?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
- and always the same Four Hundred.
Why?
Shell Oil?
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
I seem to be out of gas.
Three?
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
Where's your shell collection?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Would you do me a favor?
Anything this time?
I think you're on the right track.
I never knew it could be like this.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
You're not?
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
What'll it be, sir?
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
And who runs it?
Refresh my memory.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Perfect. All ginny.
God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
You know what? I’m not having this conversation right now.
You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
Does Kat know?
I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
What’s going on with you two?
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
I thought you said you were crap.
I’ll just check into a hotel.
Hey.
Hey, man.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
Is this supposed to be an apology?
I’m sorry?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
What does your gut say?
No, count it, anyway.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
Would you grab my shampoo?
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Yes.
I love that you’re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
Don’t stop asking questions, okay?
You have had girlfriends?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
And that’s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Hi.
Nice speech. I thought it was “touching”... and “funny.”
Like fifteen.
Oh, no. He told you.
You pawned it.
You want me to let him in?
Yeah.
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
And so you did your job, right?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
You learnin' anything at that school?
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
We didn't find Sounder yet.
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
You bet we is!
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
You hurt, Daddy!?
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
You got two shirts on?
Who's winning, Mama?
Who is they?
Did you see Daddy?
Any sign of Sounder?
Poor creature...
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
Can't sleep?
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
What's wrong with him, David?
What's wrong, Nathan?
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
Whatcha got there?
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
Hi ya, Rebecca...
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
How's the weather out there?
Where you goin'!?
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
To free Terrance and Phillip.
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
You're late, Cartman!
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Cartman?!
Mph rm rmph!!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
Mkay.
The N word?
Oh yeah.
You bastards.
What's going on, Chef?
Look at that!
Viva la Resistance.
Ber dada!
Yes I am!
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
What's that?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
Does it say what the clitoris is?
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
WHAT?
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
What about air strikes?
I am the dark master!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
The F word?!
But I-
How is the children's progress?
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
What if I just left?
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Yeah!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
I think we're moving.
Anna...
Evening.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
You gotta think of your old age.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
It's getting hard to breathe...
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Explosive?
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
And what are you going to do?!
Dawn.  Come in.
I'm in the bridge.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
What the hell are you doing?
So close...
Will you marry me?
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
I'm fine.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
Well now what are we gonna do!
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
You a mini-golfer?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Three whips. To go.
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Sure, Sid.
What's on your mind, Miles?
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Who gave it to you?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
What the fuck is this?
No...
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
We ain't married no more.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Son?
Hello?
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Knock-knock.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
Junior.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Yeah.
Get that outta your mouth!
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Kinda tough on the butt.
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Do you talk with your mom?
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Come on, bargain with me.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
Nothing.
I can't tell you, Theo.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Lips still for sale?
Who identified the body?
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Nice work, Captain sir.
What was that?
Norman, please!  Don't!
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
You don't want to know.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
Edmunds?
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Any sign of Harry?
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
Ted?  Captain?
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
What?
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
She wired this system.
Look at this.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
Resetting the sub.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
Norman!
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
You said something to him, didn't you?
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
Wait a second --
Page 87.
He translated it wrong.
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Nothing about drowsiness.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
What is it, Norman?
The sphere looks different.
What's wrong, Norman?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
How do you feel about snakes?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Do you fear them?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
He can't manifest.
You're insane.
That's bullshit.
Shut up, Beth --
Don't, Beth.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Would it work?
How's that?
Pussy.
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
You holding up alright?
Don't be defensive.
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
I can't believe that, Harry.
No.  I didn't say that.
Norman?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Wisconsin's your answer.
That's right.
What is it?
Did I kill her?
I can't reach her.
Hold on.
C'mon, Norman!
Her legs are in the way.
You know how to work this thing?
Well, press something!
What'd you say to him?
English?
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
What report?
You want me to try?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Squint harder.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Well, he's polite.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
Good morning!
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
What is it?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Well, I practice a lot...
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
See Threepio... do you copy?
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Johnny, wait...
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
So ?
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Zander, what are you doing ?
Good for you.
You can't walk me home.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
He's nothing like you.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
You're late.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Uh, look, Diz...
Man, they're defended... no way in.
Hey, Diz...
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Oh, my, what's that ?
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
Mr. Rasczak.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
On whose authority, Corporal ?
What do you think you're doing ?
Let's go.
Can you walk ?
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
All dead except one, sir.
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
Who is...'V'ger'...?
<U>Why</U>...?!
<U>Why</U>?!
What does that mean?
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
To join, and become One with the Creator?
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Granted.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
Hello, Ilia.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Was he difficult?
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Hold station.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
One hundred kilometers...
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
The people in New Hampshire.
Well, it had sentimental value.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
You haven't heard of it.
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
What I need to <u>say</u>...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
What are you doing down there?
You like kids?
Fix my glasses.
It's for your finger.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
What's the scene...
...yes.
Where you going?
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
That's something a man could do...?
Pelting down out there.
Yeah, you?
We could live up here, live up in the country.
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
But it'll stop the movie.
What are you going to do?
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
...why am I here...?
How big is this horse?
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
<u>Bobby</u>...
You do...?
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
You have no right to...
I love Jewish men.
You have to hide.
We're just talking about the...
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
And you know what...?
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
Why not?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
Doug, the traffic light...
Doug...
I'm looking for the writer.
Mmmm.  You have children?
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
He saw the girl in the car...
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
Not now.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
Why?
I've got a date.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
You can't write it?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
What is that...?
My oh my.
How was your flight?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
It's just a formality.
<u>Find</u> it.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
Wally...?
I want them thrown in jail.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
...the damn thing...
She coulda done better than him.
You think so?
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
Ben!  What's wrong?
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
So why are you asking me?
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Look she's upset --
Wow.  Who's that for?
I can't hear you.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
Hold lunch!
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
Great.  Big ears, too?
I hate her.  I really hate her.
IS THAT YOU?
Mommy?
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
That I do.  Always will.
I'm fine, ba...
Find the bird cage?
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
It's not good enough.
You say that like I don't know that.
And when did that pass?
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
Are you here?
Rachel's not half my age.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
It's a huge moment in their life --
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
Yet another spaghetti night.
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
I need practice.
However many.  It's not enough.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Did I hear the word...
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Okay, I'm undeserving.
And you said...?
So.  Hopeful.
I really look like shit.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
Thanks for coming out.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
Why didn't I?
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
But?  But what?
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
Why in the world would she t...
I needed some time away.
I told her I loved her.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Where you goin'?
Out! Leave the table!
There's something I need to talk about with you.
No prob. I'm cool.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Consuelo?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Speak English.
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
No, you don't.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
We're not ready!
Don't even joke about that!
Marty...
We used pull.
Was anyone in my room today?
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
You're tired of me. I can tell.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
So? How was school today?
Get the hell outta here!
Whaddya wanna talk about?
You're not.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
...gger.
OK.
Hello?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
That's good.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Huh. Kids?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
You know...I like you.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
Now what?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
How goes the roll call?
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Thank you, Admiral.
Where are you trying to reach him?
Yes?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
I'm trying to, sir.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
Check.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Primary circuit is live.
What happened?
How do you know he's dead?
He's dead, all right.
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
What do you mean?
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Maybe the warning system's out.
Have you tried the emergency system?
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
Forget it.
At the bottom of mines?
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Can I have some?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
It was pretty bad, huh?
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Yup.
It's really not about anything.
A cloud.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
No, I'm here. Where are you?
I'd get bored.
Go!
Fuck it!
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Tim...
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Great.
So, then, you're, like, available?
Buff.
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
It's safe, come on.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
It's okay.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
No, but I heard it was great.
Whoa!
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
You make videos?
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Yeah!
What's up guys?
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
I'd like to.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
That's what I mean.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
I'd love to read that.
It's coming along.
See ya later.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
I don't know.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Oh! Trim it!
Was that supposed to be me?
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Oh, yeah?
How?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
What?
Oh, yeah?
I've run out of words.
Hey, Pony.
Sorry.
Really?
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Look, get down off my property.
Get off my roof!
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Yeah?
No, she was just sitting there?!
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Would I get paid?
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Alright, alright already.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
Tim?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Your manager?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
So where are you?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
The fuck not?
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
I'm in, too.
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
Oh... What are you working on?
I'm sorry.
Kansas!
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
Ammo?
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
Is that you down there?
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
Really...
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
This is Miss Kramer.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
I've been hoping to run into you.
I didn't.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
With a wildly beating heart.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
What has Artie to do with it.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
So do I.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
You bet.
Hers.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's what I want to talk to you about.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
There sure is.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
What's that?
They've come for my car.
How about some evening clothes?
You think this is all very funny.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
Wanted what?
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
I'm the greatest star of them all.
You are not dressed properly.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Whose room was this?
What doctor?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
And she's turned you into a servant.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Got a title?
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
What does it mean?
Why did she have to show up now?
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Home?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
At last. Ultimate Power.
What's happening?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Let me kiss you.
Is this how?
I don't love you any more.
Hi.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
Wait. Don't leave me.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
I bet they do.
Why should I believe you?
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
Guess! Go on.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
There isn't any.
She did that deliberately.
How'd you do that?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
What's it like?
What is this place?
There is a way.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Not enough vodka in it.
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
You're welcome...??
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
You know what's the problem?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Me??
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Name?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
A television set?
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Gus?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
Man, what is this?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
When?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Is this whitemail?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
A computer.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Anything.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
No, we're just going down.
Who's the other woman?
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
What terrific story?
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
How would you know?
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
I can't see anything.
85,000 dollars.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Are you okay?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Uh. . .
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Where were you?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
What??
It has everything.
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
He flies as well, then . . .
He has powers as we do . . .
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
Superman! The --
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
You are master of all you survey.
I've never been in a place like this before.
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
Superman? Has something happened to him?
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
And what do we get out of it?
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Impossible? Why?
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Yes, darling?
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
But he's never there.
What's he going to say?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
The one Superman wrecked up?
What was that about?
You think he'll find us.
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
I'm not going anywhere.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
I know, but  --
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Mother...
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Shut up.
Damn!  This will get him.
What's the temperature now?
What do you suggest, my dear?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
I don't understand.
You got wax in your ears?
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Then -
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Two.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
I guess I got carried away
Lois, the kickback story...
Wha'...what are you doing here?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
Do you like pink?
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
Luthor  --
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
Yes.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Say hi to Zoe.
I hope she gets better.
My name is...
I can help you.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Good night, Billy.
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
About the Ottos?
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Excuse me?
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
It's for the school bazaar.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
How was it?
So do you like your new room?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
Nicole!
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
Yes.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Dolores.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
What do you mean?
Yes.
Have they ever been busted?
How old is she?
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
DADDY!!!
What for?
Do you have the blood test?
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
What time in the morning was this?
Yes.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Why were you scared?
That was great.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
What are you up to, Nicole?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
What do you mean?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
Will the police do anything to her?
She'll move away.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Will you mind your own business!
He's somewhere...
Come on boys, break it up...
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
Uh huh.
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
I know Steve.  No.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
Talk to her, Sidney...
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
I thought he would.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
That's the third time he's called today.
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
If that's for me, tear it up!
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Did you now?  On which bounce?
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
I tried to reach you twice -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
My God.
You sure?
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
Affirmative.
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Why do you cry?
Pain causes it?
This is tactically dangerous.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
No shit?
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
They took him from me.
Kyle, don't go!
You look like handmade shit.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
The CPU from the first terminator.
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
What does he mean, too correct?
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I'm very sorry.
So, what does the Russki want?
So what is it?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Yes, David?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
You bet.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
What?
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
You live here, in Berlin?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Think you can get me any of that?
Mine's the Eleventh.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
How come?
Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
Steve Arnold...
What did Goering say?
What telegram?
Von der Null?
I have no idea.
I'm sorry.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
How can I know such a thing?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
What?
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
One of your people told me.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
So, you never heard of him.
You were in insurance before the war.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Can you handle it?
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
Just let me go.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
I caught one, back there.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
About what?
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Hot dogs?
He'll find us, won't he?
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
Sarah.
And who was the enemy?
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Send a unit.
Same shit.
Did you play recently?
You don't talk to me like that.
Clean out your locker.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Alright... okay...
This is nuts.
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
Home.
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
I'll give you a boost.
There's a ladder here.
You're the one who started running.
There goes a thousand dollars.
That one did.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
Goodnight.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Where'd you get this?
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
What?
I don't know.  A lot.
What do you think you're doing?
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
What the fuck are you... ?
It's mine...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Nicholas...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Yes.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Really?
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
What are you doing?
How do you mean, exactly?
What have they been doing to you?
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
The phone's dead.
Split it?
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
I need your car, Elizabeth.
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
I'll explain someday.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Oh... it's a game.
May I make two suggestions... ?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Where?
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Guess!
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Dinner's in the oven.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Not much, I think.
What's this about?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Hey... !
How concerned should I be?
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Luke, can I talk to you?
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
And those are Luke's and mine.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
Is that the question of compassion or science?
It's not going to hold your weight.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Was sure she'd be in here.
It's still an electric shock!
All the carvings.
What did it smell like?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
Hmm.
It was a stupid thing to do.
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
Come on.
You know what he's really upset about?
This is where we're going?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
When do we take the tests?
Oh God, we can't get out!
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
What do you want?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
How could he have left without his keys?
David.
Is it over?
Theo... Did you?
I've never had a pedicure before.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Am I a thing?
As soon as you get dressed.
Anything but Japanese.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian?
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
I like the colors.
What's the matter?
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Edward Rama?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
What?
What's so fucking funny?
What are we standing on?
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Ashamed.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
I see.
I bet.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
Are you serious.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
I don't believe it.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
I guess you're just habitual.
Yeah, I guess you are.
So what's your beef, pal?
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Don't you work with Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
Hey.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
She's nice lookin'.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
What?
I don't get it.
How we gonna get that lucky?
He's expecting you?
Pleasure.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Hello, Ed.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Ann--
Yeah.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
You're an enthusiast.
...I wanted to make you happy.
...she can go up there.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
...You bring a check?
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Where you going?
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Honey.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
Yeah.
No thanks.
I'm fine.
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
...So, uh, who should I--
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
...Did you make that up?
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Jesus...
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
...I'm Crane.
Second chair.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
Someone broke into this room.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
Forget it!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Lieutenant --
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
This place is a maze.
Lieutenant!  It's me.
Curious.  There's something missing.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
We're not supposed to go back there.
Oh... my... God!
Jesus, what is this?
What?
What kind of egg is it?
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
How does it work?
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
I don't understand.
What was it?
That was D'Agosta.
What is it doing?
Just like John.  He won't listen.
Close up?
Cue music...
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
Who are you?
What's he doing?
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
Why not?
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
Marlon--
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
What're we doing here, Truman?
What exactly?
What's that?
How did it go today?
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
It'd be an adventure.
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
What's the hurry?
What do I do?
Let's go now.
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
How are you, Mother?
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
--Darling--
It looks so small.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
They're coming.  Any minute.
Not supposed to talk about it.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
No, they don't.
You've got something to show me.
This man's still alive.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Do I know you?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
A plague?
Negotiating with whom?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
You didn't know my father --
Jesus, Mulder...
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Had you.
Scully...
Scully?
You're... quitting?
What are you implying, Scully?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
And you've never seen anything like that?
This looks like new grass to you?
What do you think it is?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
Cold...
On whose orders?
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
Are we being watched?
Where's Scully?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Why are you telling me this?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Where is he?
More concerns than that?
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
He hates me.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Miriam...
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Nothing.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Damn him.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
What happened?
They're hungry.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Already there.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
When did he lapse into the coma?
Catherine!
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Nervous?
Any psychiatric medication?
What about narcotics?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Is she alright?
That's a secret.
So?
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
His own doctor?
Drink?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Tell me about him.
When...what did you do?
Let's go away.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
He liked to laugh.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
Are you going, too?
...is there?
...Headquarters.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Nichts danke. Kein.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
He works in a military hospital.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Where?
Been here long?
Him dying like that.
Listen, Callaghan.
What the devil?
Miss Schmidt.
...a week ago.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
It's a military hotel.
...of Santa Fe."
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
Heard of Harry Lime?
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
Very popular, sir.
I want to talk to you.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
...were of you.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Thank you.
Find out?
Speak English?
Coffin?
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
...give evidence.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
What else did he tell you?
Third Man.
Should I make it all fact?
...Mr. Martins?
Excuse me.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
I don't know - I'm American.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
Francoise -
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
What's a fascist?
What do you think you're doing?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
What do you care?
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
You will.
Where'd you get this?
How come there's no punctuation?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
What's it about?
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
No. What are you looking for?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Why are you taking that?
An investment banking house.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
Is it okay if I record this?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
Who? How would I know him?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Give me a reason not to.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Explain it so I can.
I always won.
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
Don't tell me what I --
No!
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
Do you feel you're making progress here?
What is happening?
What about chicken?
Get out of here....
Not too fast.
You remember Miriam....
Who's this?
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Do you think I...
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
You're going to live here permanently?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
The Italian, I presume?
He seems to have won it.
This is a great pleasure.
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
You forgot the Hula!
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Ten thousand.
Roberto?  How long?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
And... does the voice come back?
You're the best, Enzo!
I don't have one.
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
It's okay.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
No, no!
What?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Anybody can have a bad day!
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
Don't you have a heater?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
You jumped in?
You sure?
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
This is the hotel San Domenico?
In my apartment?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Well?
It's his heartbeat.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Who... Who is that?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Wait!  Professor...?
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Please. Will you help me?
There won't be any need for that sir.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Want to get a drink?
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
Esther!
So don't show a picture.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Mom! We're eating!
How do we bypass it?
What are you doing?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What's your shpiel, Santa?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Mmm———yes.
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
They don't say it to me.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head —- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ——
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
Something black —- something on its way to you ——
Don't look at it!
See you tomorrow —-
Love is different for different people.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
Some crazy guy.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
What are you getting at?
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
Get it out of here!
On his back, I suppose.
No —- not yet.
Get it out of here!
That's easy. Me.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
You look swell in that three—alarm number --
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Who was the other man?
It must be the altitude —— you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot—and—saddle boys --
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Who is he?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
I got into a little crap game.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Good afternoon. De Moraes’s residence.
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother’s death.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if I don’t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
I still don’t buy your story but I figured it can’t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
You lost my money?
Are we understood?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard?
I’m really sorry you were not called...
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
How... When did you...
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid’s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? “Leon does his own prints. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’”.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it’s the way you say them...
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
To get me killed...?
You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
Then find another way.
They’d never let me go. And you’d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
I’m calling about the puppies.
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
Ever seen him before?
Where?
What company?
How many of you scumbags are here?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
Where is it?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
I came to feed your fish. I didn’t know...
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Any friends?
The £1,000 is on account.
What happens now?
Vous êtes Français?
Let’s go.
Clients come and go.
Where is Friedman?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
Is this Friedman?
What are you talking about?
Five to three. You’re early.
Your lady friend did.
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
I can’t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What’s your sister’s number?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
I’ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Huh... I guess you ain’t quite ready for civilisation yet... I’ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you’re on your way.
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
What about which girlfriend?
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
J’ai bien peur qu’il te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
When they realise I’m missing...
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Costliest!
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
I also need someone who can read and write.
Who do they think I am?!
Jeanne, stop it!
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
Does he have hair?
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
How many did he give you?
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
My... visions...
Why would they?
God asked you to do something?
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
"Love your enemies"...
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
I don't want to wait for his call.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I'm going to get a doctor.
Really?
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
I need help.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Have you seen this?
What's happened?
Halina?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
What's this about?
Boys, boys...
You know what we do? We use psychology.
What did you pay him?
I can look after myself!
Very appropriate.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
Are the Russians here?
What about you?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Szpilman.
Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.
No, it was a table.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
She looks tired.
What's he say?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
You don't want to learn.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Wash them again.
What?
Play a gig.
Mama.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
You got a bag or somethin?
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
I'm out, Johnny.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
I like griftin'.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Mottola.
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
They're still looking for him.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
You just worry about your end, kid.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
Henry.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
You beat him, kid.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
See and raise 1,000.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
Who are you?
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
It isn't any better.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
So could Shaw.
And you were gonna pay me back?
Well, what did I tell ya?
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
You stayin' in or not?
Will you wait until the chump is played?
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
Why did that man want to kill him?
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
What is it? Has he found him?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
No.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Then what are you hiding?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Not that scrawny little....? 
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
Come on in.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
This is my wedding.
Not at all.
Shrapnel!
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Did you kill her?
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Have you got a pistol permit?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
He's holding out on you.
Well, what'd you think?
Trail him!  Trail who?
He telephoned me today.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
But he's interested!
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I'll get some.
Why, you said...
Who's that man?
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
That's my business.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
My wife.
It might.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
Why tell me?
You might have mentioned me first.
You got types?
What hit me?
Who's that?
Isn't that my drink?
What are you going to do with it?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Good. I want to talk to you.
There's one coming.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
I never saw that before.
Aren't you hot in that?
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Well, don't they?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
I've got a lulu -- why?
Who do you think did it?
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
You his wife?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I'm sorry...  but...
Home?
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
What happened?
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
You're out of your mind.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Wes--
So you can give us away?
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
They're not going to--
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
What?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
Don't!
They're doing more than slapping.
X marks the spot.
Where the hell is it!?
If they land--
It's just a mongoose.
What?
Wes might be right about that.
We should head Northeast.
How!?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
I don't want to die.
Sorry.
Wonder how the war's going?
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
What do we do?
What do we do?
Is that good, or bad?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Well?
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Epps.
Woods.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
What does that mean?
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
You get it yet?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
Jaeger?
At-at-at-at-at.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
You down?
What the hell are you doing!?
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
Drug evasion with....
Control ON.
You know I don't feel well.
I've never been under the table before.
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
I thought you were through with it!
Who?  Who's leaving?
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Well?
Not very encouraging.
What's going on?
I'll report you.  It's....
I'm leaving.
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
I don't know.
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
No...no you're wrong.
Yes.
Yes.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
What're you talking about?
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Why do you do it?
So cut both.
Which one's which?
How long were you hooked?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
What's up?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
How do you know?
Keep talking.
Yeah, another round thing.
Which one's which?
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
Any word?
Alright!
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
Alex, please-
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
He is!
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
Pooch, can you move it?
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
You don't fish.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
You okay?
Make an appointment.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Device.
A what?
So what're we looking for?
Captain...
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
It's our only option.
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
<u>Niente!</u>
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No.
Good morning, Major.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Two weeks and three days.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
Monescu.
Thank you!
The pepper, too?
Right.
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
Two fifty-three, five--
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
You like that statue?
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Do you know my first name?
Oh? 
It's disgraceful!
The same thing.
Then lunch in the Bois--
Yes, I would!
Any minute I want!
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
You look beautiful.
Adolph J. Giron.
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
Yes, madame?
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Yes, madame?
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Didn't you take it with you?
How much time?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
None of the stewards have seen her.
She's not on the starboard side either.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
I make my own luck.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
My God... Cal. Is it a --
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
But I was with him the whole time.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
The boats are all going.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
Why have we stopped?
The fall alone would kill you.
HELP! HELP!!
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
What's this?
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
And...?
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
Where to, Miss?
It's bad.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Yes sir.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Hope we're not intruding.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Oh--a hundred times--
Feeling a little better, I see.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Good afternoon--
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
Where'd you get it?
What did you want a gun for?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Aces full.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Like her paint job?
You've got lipstick all over you.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Tell me.
Don't be a c-a-t.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
Thanks.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
I could see you were pining away--
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
A dollar forty.
Not a chance.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
About sixteen hundred.
Come in! 
It's your deal.
I'm going to the show--
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Hello, young fellow!
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
Here you are, sir. 
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
What?
That's me!
Yes--Me--in person!
Hello, Denby!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
Well, let's hear the poem--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Get that out of your trunk.
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Can you read 'em Jack?
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
Not because of Ned.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
Yes, Yes!
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
He's certainly good-natured.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
God damn son of a...
Oh, my God...
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
A peace officer... Impressive man
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
I asked where you got him.
Shut up, Ike.
I want them spitting blood!
I'm retired.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
Doc!  How the hell are you?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
So what does he want?
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
You really look awful.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
I hate Sadie.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Come up to the fire, honey.
Mattie.  What about this?
Well hello, Sherm.
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
I don't like it.
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
Get down, boy.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
You'll never make that stick.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
Briefly.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Paris -
Just - say it. Say it just once.
His newspapers?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
She married a hockey player.
Can you arrange a meeting?
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Where to now, Jimbo?
No.
Boyfriend?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
I'll keep that in mind.
No?
... Do you have a gun?
Not a lot of difference.
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
Sorry I'm late -
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
... And what do you call these?
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
Who's in charge here?
I was an attorney!
You won't get away with this!
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
The back-up does the same thing.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
What the hell is going on?
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Will it go off?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
It was nip and tuck.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
Not anymore, not in the city.
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
How is the garden doing?
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
That smells like fresh coffee.
Good afternoon, ladies.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Those boys never did have good luck.
How many people do you all feed?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
Did you have your child at home?
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Wow!  Cool!
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Yeah?!
Here!  In the car!
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Hello-o-o...
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
According to my nava-computer, the --
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Woody?!  What are you doing?
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
I don't know!
Hey!!
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
A lunchbox?!
ROOAAAARR!!!
It's Sid!
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
This is ludicrous.
Bad news?!
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
I can't hold on much longer!
I can manage.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
He made that. In his off hours.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
Everything is gone, now.
You're well built; how old are you?
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
Why does he need money?
How much?
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
Should we bring the police into this?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Is this bad for him?
Helena --
Private?
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
What do we do?
What do you think she wants?
I'll put this in the back.
Yes.
They're going to walk right past me.
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
Oh, man --
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Hello.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
For fuck's sake.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Great.
Sorry.
What?
Jesus.
What do you want?
No.
Well, it isn't.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
There's no need.
Clear?
Have you got any gear on you?
But try too hard --
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Did he -- you know?
You know.
Cut it out.
What?
How long is it?
Six weeks!
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
A walk.
With a starship!
It could. Yes.
But the shuttle-
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
Can we have it quiet?
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Your pain runs deep.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
But how?
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
Jim.
But he does seem familiar?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
There, you see? See?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
Is it possible?
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
I believe I have found a faster way.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
What are you doing?
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
Your vision?
You are mad!
What have I done?


I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
Each man's pain is unique.
Why not?
I don't get it.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Beautiful!
Yeah...?
What do you mean, "'yes"?
That all you can say?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
What, just the three of us?
Hey... you guys OK?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
Watch it!
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Do you know what he's talking about?
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
We have to get off this beam!
You bitch.
Can you cover me for an hour?
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
What's this for?
What a team.  See you at eight.
Thanks dear.
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
Station wagon?
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Just hang a minute.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
Any minute now.
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
My husband is a good man.
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
I'm late.
Uh huh.  Okay.
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
My husband can't know about this.
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
What were you doing there?
Is it working yet?
Are we going to die?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
You working on someone right now?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Hello?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
I didn't get any chicken.
Tell him to look through it.
Sonny kicks ass.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
'Bout twelve.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
"Heroes For Sale"?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
No no no no no no no no no...
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
I think what you did was...
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
You'd really do that?
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
Who the fuck are you?
I'm a married man.
Money problems?
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Do you really mean it?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
What?
No. No, you don't.
He wants to talk ya.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I can, but I don't.
I'm really not very -
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
What makes you think I would do that?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
That Vietnam movie?
Do you believe him?
He'll wear a wire?
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
We gotta get him outta there.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
What was I sayin'?
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Preach on, Big D.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Yes.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
I understand.  There'd be no point.
To be determined by the proper authorities.
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
Do you know why you're here, James.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
Do you know what year it is?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
You used to call me "James".
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
They're keeping an eye on me.
We need gas.
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
No, thank you.
Nine thirty
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
What?  What did you say?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
Maybe I do.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
Accident.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Hey.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
How much?
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Please, just leave the car alone.
What you want?
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
What was that all about?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Least you can leave.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What happens if you lose?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
Beautiful?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I'm guessing no.
I don't know how.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Jake.
John, please--
There is no us, remember?
Grace . . . Grace?
Where's the safe?
You got a suitcase?
To get my car.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
John . . .?
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
What?
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
What happened to your hand?
Live there?
Hey!
Why would I kill her?
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Now what can I do for you?
Talk?  About what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
You love her, but you hate her?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
You think that's a lot of money?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
I came for Grace.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
They're not very imaginative?
Christ, I don't believe this.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
The old lady?
Do you understand me you little fuck?
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
I call the policia.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Now, what's this?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
What can I do for you, lad?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Shhh! Liar.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Got any requests?
But you was going to fight for me.
Will he be back soon?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Great!
Accident.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Hey.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
No charge.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I like that about me, beautiful.
Accident.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
What do you do anyway?
My face tell you all that?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Yeah.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
Hope is a four-letter word.
I busted my leg!
<u>Jake</u>...
Morning, officer.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
What'd you say to me!
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Son of a bitch!
Who was that on the phone?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
I axed you a question.
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
Is Jeremy okay?
Oh shit...
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
I remember you.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
Would you like to try going--
...I think rust.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
I assumed because of the train.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
I don't know what you're asking?
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
He's kind of a miracle.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I'm going to work out.
What do you do if something happens?
I'm sleeping in my room.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
He doesn't look very threatening.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Scouting?
Oh. Yeah.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
They really got all that money, them whores?
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
The... Duck of Death.
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
Schofield? You from Schofield?
What for?
You're goin' back with him?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Yeah, he's in there.
Is it him?
Say, Bill...
First one I ever killed.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Three ways?
She gave me the evil eye.
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
That fella come by... Tom.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
No... I meant...
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
That ain't what I mean.
There was ninety-one million -
I don't get it.
Who ?
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
This is not right.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
You heard right.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
What are we gonna do?
Me too.
You watch your mouth.
Three million?
No killing?
How are you, Keaton?
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
When does he post bail?
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
I don't know about that.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
You're stalling, Verbal.
Then what?
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
This is all bullshit.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
You're joking.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Yes.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Objection!
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I did.
No further questions.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
Just now...
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
She getting good care over there?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Dr. Gruber ...
Yes.
) I'm sorry ...?
Do you know who her doctors were?
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
What is it?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
What Hotel are you staying at?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
Hi, Mickey ...
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
... I'm sure you do ...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
I used to be a nurse.
Yes.
What did she say?
Another, Frank . . . ?
I want to buy you a drink.
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Yes.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Would you like a drink now?
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Hello.
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Just let me talk to you.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Then will you for me?
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Will you, Judy?
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
Scottie, what are you doing?
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Where are you going?
Why?
I'm scared.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
Scottie, please...!
Love me... keep me safe...
Do you remember where you were?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
I don't know.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Would you like a drink of water?
Have you been here before?
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
What else?
Don't leave me... stay with me...
No, don't go away!
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Let me go! Let me go!!
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Oh, yes!
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
Ow!!
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
How's your love life, Midge?
My... the acrophobia.
I think I can lick it.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Here you are.
Is she pretty?
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Around.
What have you been doing?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Well...
I said how's it going?
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
Go home!
Don't even start.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Stop it!
Bury her out in the desert.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
How do you figure?
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
You got us into this mess.
What is your problem?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
Are you solid with that?
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
Have you thought about what I said?
Money?
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
What?
She's not here.
Who?
That's right.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
I got her arm.
He just had two.
He's too drunk.
We need padded chairs.
Nobody knows she's here.
What kind of words?
Boyd...What have we done?
I just want to get married.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
Take care of business.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Okay fine.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
I don't hate women.
Not true.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Take Mexico.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
We're goosed.
Stop it!
Stop.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Photographer?
Florist?
Caterer?
Why?
Why did you forget the tent check?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
Time out.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
We've got problems here.
Keith do not trivialize this.
What about the chairs?
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
I know.
You fucked a prostitute?
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
That ought to be about the end of that.
You alright?
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
We will.
Right.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Are there many windows?
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Which couch?
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
Yes, it is.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
You're lying.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
Is it all right?
How much is that?
That's fifteen by seven?
So, Ramona!
How in hell does it wind up?
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Are they going to work here too?
And ...your friend?
Are your parents alive?
You cannot leave ...
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
He came in through the cupboard.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Have I slept long?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
It was very well—hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
You all right?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
What happens if I can't catch him?
You know how much man power you're talking about?
What did Cox pull him out early for?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
I haven't been working on anything.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
I wonder how that...
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
It was you, wasn't it?
You catching my drift?
He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
Who said that?
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
We know you didn't kill those guards.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Nice work.
More or less.
How's your pulse?
What do we do now?
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you——
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
What about it?
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
Mr. President, this is St...
...mmm?
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
We're going to have to explain away the...
What crisis?
What would do that...?
Tell, tell, tell me again.
Tell me again.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
<u>Who</u>?
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
...can we see the Kitten...?
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
How long you been up, you need a nap.
...I just missed my plane.
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
Oh, God...
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
That's not bad at all.
Wilfred.
What about him?
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
Hello...?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Why do they go to War?
Would you go to War to do that? 
It can be documented that he displayed the...
Dartmouth
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Remember the Maine...
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
"The Country Is At War." 
We don't need an Act Two.
You can't have a war without an enemy.
"Back End" ... count on it.
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
I think it's fine?
In the Folk Music Section.
...this the Guy.
...we get our hands on him?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
Wake up.
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
I'm tired.
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
Bunny:  I had an idea:  a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>...  Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>.  What I'm wondering:  what do we <u>call</u> it...  You got my number... 
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
All part of the Service we Render.
Shoes, Hats....
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.
...as of today, 89% favorable.
The Special Anti-Terrorist Detachment of the Border Patrol... what do they <u>do</u>...?
Long's you git me back for the beans...
This is <u>nothing</u>,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a <u>pharmacist</u>, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
Grand Marnier.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
...if I had your looks, better.
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
What the hell...
Speak English will ya.
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
Don't start, alright.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Whatever night you like.
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
Your words, not mine...
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
...thanks Natalie.
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Hello Bud.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Where is it?
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
I don't.
Do you think you're ready?
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
How you doing Buddy?
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
But?
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
Haven't we been doing our homework.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Come on.
Oh that explains everything.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well?
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Of course you will.
That was very good.
He loves you very much.  He just--
Are you mad at me?
I didn't want to come.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Your friend saw them.
She said, "You know."  That I know.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
That can't feel good.
How're you holding up?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
Well maybe your wife...
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
Would you like some iced tea?
No.
What's your name?
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
You look a little old for a student.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
You should have heard her play.
You are?
Seance.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Someone's there.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
Okay.  Okay.
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
What's their name?
When's she out of here?
Claire, I have to show up for the--
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
Did you...
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
Claire?
I think so.  Maybe.
Yep.
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Our house.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Tonight?
What are you doing out here?
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Keep your voice down.
You know I am.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
Ow!
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Your wife...
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
I tried to break it off!
Claire...
Mmmuh...
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
I beg your par---
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
STOP!
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
Made it...?
To love, you must be able to feel.
If that were true, I would not be here.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
Do not tell me that!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
My jury's still out on that,
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Why don't you let at do that...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Hello...?
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
When aid you get home last night...?
Something's wrong with you.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
I can't.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Wow...
You okay...?
He's got great hands.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
Sounds good - thank you
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Sugar?
So what do you do?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
You've killed but you're not a killer
And how did it feel to be rid of him
What?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Where are you going?
Why did you let him in?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
I want you out now
It's been what, three years?
I thought it was you - how are you?
Dead?
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
You're late, bro!
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
You're way ahead of me again?
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Finally, some gratitude.
Sorry I--
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
I-I don't have the keys.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Ted! Do something!
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
If you could just sign right there.
Great.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
I see.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
You think you're working with chimps here?
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
I'm warning you.
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
I told you you could do it.
You were the new and improved you.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
What are you doing?
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
She's going to wash your Jeep?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
How long?
I don't know what to say...
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
You saw the news today?
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Guess I kind of lost it there.
We all have...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Where's the body?
Will you do me one favor?
About a year ago.
Yeah.
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
She bit you?
This wasn't my idea.
It's those rocks, up there.
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
I'm here.
Hello?
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Good thinking.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
It doesn't look like it.
Davy.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
You mean this thing?
Jesus, man... You okay?
But I..
That was about as grim as it gets.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
But don't pull that again.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Aha!
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
No record of him.
What's this?
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
What is that?
When we find him, he is mine.
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
He calls it the Tarantula.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Your private train, sir.
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
You're not that big.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
The first.
Now it's a bomb.
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
You left me to die, friend.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
They look like acorns.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
You all right?
What's that?  I hear something!
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Where's the baby??
Did she ask about me?
She's in love.
What's the magician's weapon?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
What'd you bit me for!!
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
We gotta follow them.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
She's hungry.
Talk!  Say something!
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Everything is all right, John.
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Are they going to kill you?
Are you really ever coming back?
Amish.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Just us.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
But why would they murder...
But why?
How long have I been here?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
We had some lemonade and he left.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Anybody know about this?
It's me.
I'm coming.
You hear me?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Did you find him?
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
What's so funny?
God, Fred...
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
I will be the judge of that.
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
Momma... are they angry with us.
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Uhh -- yeah --
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Are you ready now?
Yes, I'm ready now.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
That's our farm!
Oh --
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Now you're seeing reason.
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Oil can.....Oil can....
Oh --
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, he's just ascared again.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Oh, my!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
I'll be home in time for supper!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Because I'm still scared!
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Does it work?
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Um-hmm.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
I don't blame you for that.
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Yeah.
Dorothy next!
I've got a plan how to get in there.
And you're going to lead us.
That's right.
Whozat?
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
Where do we go now?
...Tin Man!
To Oz?
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
No, you don't.
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Who’s she?
What is it?
The King pipeline.
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
Beautiful, isn’t it?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
I understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
One... last... screw?
You, of course. I need some information.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
The Maiden’s Tower.
What?
This is the end.
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
No idea who's behind this?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
Blake?  Dead?
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Jon, where are we?
Jon --
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
She's with me.
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
. . . What?
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
-- What is it.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
What was he doing?
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
Where's Laurie?
What happened?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
I can fix it.
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
What about you?
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
New information.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Why is that?
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
Thanks.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
But programmable. And expendable.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Like what?
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Hey, you're good.
Go to hell!
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Are you alright?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Yorgi and Kirill.
Where'd the damn truck go?!
The Peace conference...
What...?
You're serious?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
That was for Anders.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
Jean... can you?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Come with me and I'll let her live.
What am I doing here?
Now that's Magneto talking.
Where are we going?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
Is that what you're looking for?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Oh, shit.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Darling!
Darling!...you will be careful!?
You have your tickets?
And your passport?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Promise??
Darling!
Love me?
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
What?
I didn't do that.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
Aye-gor!
What a filthy job!
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
You can't win 'em all.
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
Yes, Master!
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Come on, big fellow!
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
How's everything?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
MMMmmmmmm.
Extremely well.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Would you like a sandwich?
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
A god?
It wasn't me.
It looks that way.
Do you think you can sing it?
Did you do it?
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Just passing through the night.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Yes, I will.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
No, not sound.
Look how far we've come.
Three minutes to go!
Do you have a reservation?
Drink!
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
