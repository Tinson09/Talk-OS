Cameron.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Where?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You're sweet.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I believe we share an art instructor
Then that's all you had to say.
What crap?
Let's go.
They do not!
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
What?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
It's just you.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Why?
The prom?  Kat has a date?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Just sent 'em through.
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
It's a lung cancer issue
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Yeah -- we'll see.
Don't make me do it, man
She kissed me.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
We're not.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
I didn't have a choice.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
My mission in life.
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Who?
Do what?
I'm gettin' there
Unwelcome.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Look up, sunshine
Hearsay.
Because you're making decisions for me.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
When I go?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
What's to discuss?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
See you next week!
Tumescent!
We'll all go crazy...
Excellency, you are right.
Your life, and that of others!
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
The Judgment is ours!
I know.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
Not bad.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
I'm not bargaining!
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Thousands.
Chief says -- he has a God.
He understands.
Damn God!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
We don't need to know.
My horse doesn't work.
And what do you think Mendez?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Where are we going?
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
No, he is here.  Shit...
What's your cut?  How much?
No.  No way.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Pouring it out!
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
But Chief?  Over this??
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
A timer.
Takin' a bath.
Yeah.
No.  I'm okay.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
You're Polish?
You got any better ideas?
My point exactly.
So am I.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
What do you want?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Alright?
Alright.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Yeah.  I promise.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
Not what.  Who.
I am butcher.
No.  Are you proposing?
You'll be my first.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
Yes.
How long are you planning to stay?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Okay.
Don't speak Russian!
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
Did you hurt her?
Milos.  Get my money!
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
You want the tape?  There it is!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
What are you coming here to do?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Clean?
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Aren't you tired?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Your doctor?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I guess it isn't.
No.
Yes.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Yes, it is.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Are you quite sure?
Certainly.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Any clue as to what it is?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
That's true.
Roger.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
I want to pick up my car.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Whaddya mean, buy?
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Goodbye.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
You're done.  End of story.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
What are you talkin' about?
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
How much?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Luther's on the move...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Yeah, I read the report...
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
I'm heading out. How about you?
What?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
You're hopeless.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Jack, are you okay?
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
That's what I always say.
How would you know?
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
Don't give me this, we were partners.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Naw, right here's okay.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
No thank you.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
I know...
I brought the girl remember?
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Good luck..
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
One more reason to shoot first eh?
And then?
Yes..thank God..
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Hey bud! Finger here.
I was talking to the cat.
...'Scuse me?
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
You little sleaze bag!
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
Why not?
Three of us will never fit in there!
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
What is... Make Love?
...Hoppi-hoppa.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I want to sleep... forever...
I love you...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Been here long?
Uh..
Actually only one cell survived..
Only too well... here you must be parched..
To fame.. salud..
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
...I can't wait to be among you.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
Honey, I'm not, please...
I understand.
Why the gun?
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
I don't know what to say
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
I just talked to her.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
There's nothing harder.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Hmm.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Right here.
Where are the women?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Leave him alone.
Call me Tom.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Why don't they come to me?
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Any good?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
I know what you did.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Tell me what happened.
Nobody saw you bring her in?
What did you do with her body?
Stop talking.
Of what sort?
That's right.
Never mind how I found you.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Yeah... guess so.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
There's not much illegal.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Nope.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Thank you.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
I'm afraid I don't...
You've found missing persons before.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
It got to be too much for him.
Of course.
Yes.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
You could do worse.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
We have matching luggage.
That obvious, huh?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Who?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
It's okay, we're just about there.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
It's okay, Dan
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
How did you know that?
Who said I...wait, what?
He's inside you, where he hides.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Had kind of a long night.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Well we gotta do something!
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
I guess.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
Right, Skipper.
Seems to be all around...
Something wrong?
Why do you say that?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
What direction does the system indicate?
There's got to be an explanation!
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
After torpedo room:  Report!
Thank you.
Toward the Pole!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Twombley involved?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
That was me.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Yeah?
You played for the Sox?
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Right!
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Do what?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
To us it was.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I called Mommy.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yes.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
No.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
I'm not saying that.
I figured you already heard.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Maybe.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Yeah, lots.
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
When did she die?
Where... how'd you hear that?
He got his deer yet?
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
Nothing.
She's coming.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Bang!
Crawl!
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Huh?
What happened?
Want to know what I think happened?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
For what?
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
Your father never means to be so...
Some kids were teasing you?
Jim... for godsake!
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Did we warn them off?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
About goddamn time.
why did they do that?
We're not going to make it.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
A dubious distinction, no?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
One thing I've learned as
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Gravity.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
What?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
This is the President.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
I might still have a few chips left.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Yes I did...
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Accelerators down.
There's nothing wrong with me!
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Ted!
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Not now, Elaine.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
Maybe.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Go ahead.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Yes.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
And a little ice.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Yeah...
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Yes.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Your mother mates out of season.
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
When will Strader return?
You are married?
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Nothing.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Who else can I ask around here?
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
The human?
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Whatever gave you that idea?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Corporal Hicks!?
Sorry to disappoint you.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Sure, Hicks.
Do it!
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
We didn't miss anything.
Hudson, give us a break.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Seal the door.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
And hope to die?
You're really something, ace.
Why do they tell little kids that?
I know, honey.  Me too.
That's right.
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
No.
You were sublime.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
I'm so relieved.
What??
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Eat
Well, don't do that again!
No!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Well, ask her!
Stanzi!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
No one.
You'd think I was mad.
Madame. How can I help you?
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Oh, thank you, sir!
But! I'm a married woman!
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Gertrude!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
What? On one hearing only?
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Ah! By all means.
Yes, Sire.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
He's here.
I will.
Am I not welcome?
That's not what I hear.
How many pupils do you have?
How many?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
No one calls you that.
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Are you Herr Mozart?
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Of course not.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
How much?
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
No! No, it's him!
Finish what?
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Oh, yes.
I think so.
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
But, Your Majesty -
Certainly, Herr Director.
What is what?
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Do you believe it?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
My son, no one can speak for God.
I poisoned his life.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Yes.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Excuse me, my dear.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Yes, I am looking after him.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
What happened to them?
Come to my office, Miss Price.
Yes, sir.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Has his friend appeared to him again?
What did he say?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Tea would be nice.
I dream of death mostly.
I know.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Shall I read to you?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Will you think about it?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Of course.
A doper werewolf.
I'm freezing.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Jack is dead!
What?
David, let's go now.
No.
No!
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You did, did you?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
No, but we're about to.
Oh, come on, tell us.
So they said.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
She's a jerk.
I don't know.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Shall we?
Nice to see you.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Not far enough. Come on.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Yes.
What do you think?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Hello.
How shall I do it?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Matt?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
How much?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
I haven't got it.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Why not?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Well, you can. You always could.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Oh, yeah?
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Well . . .
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Why, I don't know.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
You're protecting somebody.
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson—
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Matt, come here!
With what?
Oh, you think I'm lying?
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Yeah.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
There you are!
Yes.
Yes.
I'm okay, Matt.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
What have you done?
Nope.
Exactly.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
I think I recognize you.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
What's going on?
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Twenty?!
I got us through the War all right.
And I'm the better outlaw.
I'm thinking...
Which one, right or left?
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
They gonna rush us?
Where is Jesse James?
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
Me get heap firewater --
You're right, sir.
It's a secret.
My little Web did that?
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Mm-hmm.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
You can shut up now.
Damn. All that reading paid off.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Bob's upset.
Oh yeah.
Got any ideas, little brother?
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
A river pirate.
Sparkling rocks?
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Yes ma'am.
I'm not hanged yet.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Right here in church?
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Lyla Devereux.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Yes sir.
What is going on here, man?
I demand action.
In English, Pinkerton.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Eight?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
I'm ignoring you.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You and...Luis?
Yes, Courtney?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Is your Evian spiked?
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Everybody's rich.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
I have to return some videotapes.
Good coloring.
I know her. I knew her.
You saw the ad in the Times?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Uh huh.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
What?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Ask me a question.
Two at nine? Perfect.
See you then.
Yes, sir.
Patrick?
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
What's that?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
Hello? Jean, I need help!
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Hello 
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
No, I'm okay.
Shoot.
I know. I'm sorry.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
No. Not really.
No, he just hung out there.
Hmmm.
Oh.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
People just...disappear.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Don.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
That's not the information I've received.
Not in the mood, I guess.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Marcus?
But Marcus denied it?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
I'm hungry
Al.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Yeah, well, you're late.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
Didn't you visit the campus?
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
We're not gonna let it.
Isn't that -- extreme?
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Nothing.
...Different?
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Milo, you --
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
It's gonna get cold.
He wasn't acting?
Yes sir.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
Okay. I'm Gary.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
You're making me young again.
I'm sure.
Oh. Yeah.
You look a little tired.
'Have a look?
You see what's hanging on the wall?
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Gary, don't worry, we --
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Got out of my other commitment.
Cool.
I'm calling Gary.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
You're compulsive.
Oh yeah?
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
What?
A what?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Gary.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
What?
Wait a second. He knows I know.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
Jesus, Teddy.
I met this girl.
What does that mean?
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Or sometimes not at all.
Kiss me.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Hey, how are you?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Thank you, Exposition.
Right away, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
There's one more thing, Austin.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Why not? It's a question.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
I'm sorry?
What?
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
I am not.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
You know who.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Are you crazy?
Behave!
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Show me.
Scott, don't say that...
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
No, he's really evil.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
... bottle ...
Love...
Three days.
Have we met?
Impossible?
I have an appointment.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Thanks, Valentine ...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
Mother?
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
How on earth can you tell?
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Is there anything that isn't?
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Barely.
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
Nothing personal.
You don't trust me?
No idea who. No idea why ...
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Getting to what?
... and now?
So you say ...
How did you guess?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
She may try to kill you.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
I feel sure of it.
Perish the thought.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
You're kidding.
I want Debbie.
I'm marrying Debbie.
What is this person's story here?
The best.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Maybe it had something to do.
She's mine!
Yes I did.
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Sure have...
But how can I do that?
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
But a fabulous cook.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
It looks awful.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
What's the matter?
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Yes...
You're so romantic...
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
I know what I'm doing... Go!
I think I screwed that one once.
What's going on?
Yes.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Milt?
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Ha, ha, ha.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Rick!
My gift to you.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
I'm saved. Let's party!
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
No.  I need a drink.
We're gonna be okay, man...
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Thanks for the insight.
Just leave me alone, okay?
You're selling dad's boat?
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
I know.
Jennifer.
Really? No kidding.
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Homey.
Then why did you quit?
Uh huh.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
Just take it.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
Then who --
What?
Trychticholorate.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
What are you listening to?
No it couldn't.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
And the putty around the door?
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
But he killed these guys.
What reason?
Yeah? Airtight?
Four months.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
What the hell are we waiting for?
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
And DIE!
I'll be there.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
He's going to be a fireman.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
What's wrong?
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
He works for me.
I know you.
Did he tell you how we finally met?
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
And old ladies?
I need that report, Lt.
Investigator Rimgale.
Alderman.
No Marty, I don't.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
I was gonna bring it back myself.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Please.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
I'm a revolutionary.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
She's also moorish.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Must be the pressure.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
And this is Manray.
Did we get our bill yet?
We're starving.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
How you sound?
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Exactly!
Who are the other characters?
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Where do you go from here?
Is that so?
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
Do you know how you will use him?
This is Cheeba.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
Which one is your brother?
A gift.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
No.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
Not at all?
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Soon.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
Thank you.  And always smile.
You've never had any formal training, either?
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
She hates dem.
I thought you got rid of...
A song a comin' I feel.
What do you want to know?
Never read a book in my whole life.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
It must have been some other gate.
The coward!
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Yes, sir.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Certain?
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
It is my only object.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
Agreed.
Then you must get it.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
As much as possible.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Yes!
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
I see.
Good night, my little darling.
Yes?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Fine.
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
We found him like this...
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
It's... too slow.
I just don't like it.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
Tell me about them.
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
He's lying.
You saw West's body.
Do what?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Can't do that now, though, can you?
Sir, yes, sir!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
We just want to check your pack --
Do I?
You hated West more than any of us.
That's exactly what he says about you.
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
No. I said Dunbar.
Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
I didn't do anything --
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Who killed Pike?
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Home, I'm done.
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
You and the Colonel go back.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Why?
Excuse me?
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
Best time for banal chit-chat.
I lost a bet.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
They got their stories straight.
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Get in.
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
Really.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
We've been making progress, I see.
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
What the fuck are you doing?
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
We know.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
Sir, yes, sir!
That's great.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
I see. I thank you for your time.
Please. Go. Just go.
I know.
Lucky girl.
No, I understand.
Stop.
Can I take your picture?
I can.
Okay.
Beats me.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
So how does it happen?
Really.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Oh, so you know.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
What?
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
How what happens?
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
You say...
Yes. Exactly.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
They're your favorite flower.
Go out with me.
I'm robbing this place.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
I need to lie down for a bit.
Probably tonight.
Mmm, what?
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Yes.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
What for?
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
There's over eighty thousand here.
Yeah.
Uh... Yes.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
He says he feels safe here.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
You can stay tonight.
Good night.
Yes.
Yes.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
You don't understand anything.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
Well as it turns out I did.
No I don't.
What? No you're not..
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
Why not?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
Why?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You don't understand you either.
Get out
Thank Christ for that.
She's dead.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I'm trying to quit.
No. I think I better just go.
Please. Why not?
It's not mine either.
It's more like a date.
Thanks.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Yes?
This gonna get you in trouble?
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
At church?
You gonna sing me somethin'?
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
No, ma'am.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
She's around. Always is.
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Better'n me?
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
How long... how long I been out?
Two days?
Well I don't...
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
In my house, you watch that lip...
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Or what?
Uh-uh.
I don't fuckin' cook.
Sure.
No joke.
By myself?
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Why you say that?
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Naw!
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
Why she got a chain on her?
You could put it that way.
Rae!
You feelin' sick?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Yeah, I do.
Got in a little accident.
Let go...
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Maybe we should do something?
Number five with a bullet.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
Give us a break...
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
I can see that.
I stole them.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Ichiro --
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Good.  Very good...
You can trust me.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
Big enough.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
Why's that?
We can't lose.
He drinks.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
No one's keeping him here.
Yeah.
Right.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
It is not allowed.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
I want him.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Where?
Not to be trapped.
Then go get him.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
I am?
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
Of course not.
Dr. Tyrell?
His company made us.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
Why, yes, of course.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Prosit.
I like you too.
I gotta piss.
I don't know.
Four years.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
These aren't just...
No rust?
Meaning?
Yeah?
Do you recognize any of them?
What did she want?
What's suck night?
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
I'd never get an abortion.
Ugh.
So?
Can you?  I couldn't.
Not too good.
If they are smart, they take naps.
What?
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
I never felt better.
No, I don't.
What's up?
Yes.
What desert?
But how come I'd be there?
I don't have one.
You scared me.
Just better.
What's your problem?
What's that?
Yes?
Thank-Q!
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
No, you get out of here.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
I just had a mental picture of...
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, I'm right?
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
You don't?
Perry?
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
How long would you need me?
What?
Sorry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
A wife?
The big one!
Sure.
I told you I've never driven before!
Yes!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
That's boring!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Look unimpressed.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
I'm sorry.
Eve, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Sing it to me.
No.
It was at least as good as the sky.
Yes, it is.
What?
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Tempus fugit!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
No, son. A pitcher.
Blow out the candles!
I'll try.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes, sir. It's true.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Really?  Since when?
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
Juneau.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Yeah?
True.
I'm not wearing his pants.
I LOVE THIS!!
So, did you buy a movie?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Just look!!
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Well, we're here to help!
Sorry, Mom!
I'll be all right.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Yes.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
Yes.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Then after that it's safe.
All our friends...
I'm not hungry.
How could you?! This is just like home!
Right here!
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
You bet.
If he tells, it won't come true!
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Well, I am the head of this household--
Yes, dear, I know.
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
No.
Eve?!
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Uh..he might of.
He left with Sophie.
You're goddamn right I am!
Coward!
Give it back to him.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Then what?
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Roger, Wolf One.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I'm not sick.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I've seen a few.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Yes?
The criminals are winning.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Only you and the photo lab.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Yeah.
Yes.
No.
Nothing. Are you alright?
See my nipples?
What?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Please, please stay.
Hello.
Frank would open you.
Does that scare you?
Kiss me.
No, it's not Don.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
No thanks. What does that mean?
Here's to Ben.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I don't know. He moved away.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Why not?
Oh, okay, can I call?
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Are you sure?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
You better not, Jeffrey.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Okay. Great!
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Frank!!!
Go ahead.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Connor, is that you?
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Right.
Ass!
Aye.
How many?
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Yes.
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
I'll be back at 9:00.
Hey Murph.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
What the fuck do you mean?
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
Open it!
What do you want me to say?
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
She's an attractive older woman.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
You're right. You're right.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Because my mom gets the bill.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Bob?
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
On the left.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Where was it parked?
This morning.
You were asleep.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Can you hand me those french fries.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
What?
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
Shh.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Shut up!
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Eleven fifteen.
Take your second position.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
Nobody move!
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
Yeah.
I'm not kidding.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Dignan, I --
Thanks.
Thanks.
So do I.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
What do you mean?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Why'd you want to help us?
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
See you, Bob.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Temporarily.
You're Anthony?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Wait a second.
So who's going to know?
I'll just drive my car.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
I can't believe you said that.
I told you he's crazy.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
That's too bad.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Don't count it.
No. I was calm.
I don't know.
See you in a little while.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
Come on, Dignan.
I'm going back.
I can't do that, Bob.
Yeah. It is.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Where's Applejack?
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Here we go.
Now!
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
I'm trying.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
26 weeks.
He's damn good.
Well, I think --
Can't get it. It won't... 
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Sure.
You Hoto?
There was a mistake.
And the Landy woman?
One last push. One.
Never heard of it.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
Do you know what his budget was?
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
Don't know.
The sooner the better.
Okay... 
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
No, I do.
You killed them.
Is this really happening?
Sorry. Old habits.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Conklin.
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
Where are you going?
There must be another way!
But you found another choice.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
What is this, a game?
Bourne?
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Who's this?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Wallace's followers.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Fourteen? --
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
No. One of us is enough.
I could crush you like a roach.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
No. He did not.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
Let her speak.
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
You are. And I'll come again.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
And I with you. But you must wake.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
I am trying.
I must... consult with my father.
They've tricked us.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
And the bad news?
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
So what did you find.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
My father has a bad memory, too?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Cute, Evan.
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
Straight up.
Weirder than this?
You know my father?
I see a car.
My journals! Where are they?
Photos?
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
I've stopped a hundred times.
Of course.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
So it didn't feel... weird?
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
You'll see.
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
What?
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
Been there, done that.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Y... yes. I guess I did.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
What happened?? Where are we?!
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
I came with Captain Renault.
What is your name?
No thanks, Carl.
Come up here a minute.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Er, good luck, yes.
Er, my check, please.
It's not for sale.
It's not for sale at any price.
Practically no one.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Well, so long.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
Good day.
I will.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
And I was wondering.
Uh huh.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Has it got a wow finish?
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Yes.
You can believe that if you want to.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
No.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Yes, ma'am.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Won't you join us?
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Apparently he has the letters.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
I love you very much, my dear.
Sam?
He came from Paris with Rick.
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Go ahead.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Yes.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
We'll be there.
Thank you.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
-- Thank you.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
I expected no less, Captain.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
Huh!
Our entertainment is enough.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Victor Laszlo?
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Okay.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Huh?
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
Our expenses?
I never make plans that far ahead.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Yeah, boss?
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
You've had today's water.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Survive today, that's the point.
Fix raft first.
Why do they have to die for me?
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Nothing out there but ocean.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Sure.
Cold.
I thought I did.
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
He's your cute thing.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
You can't go now.
I can't take him to work.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
You have any children?
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
Yeah?
It means a lot...that you came.
And how was your Christmas?
I most definitely say I am.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
No.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
It was fifteen minutes late.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
I braided them.
Time I had lots of.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Believe me I know.
What?
Deep, real deep.
No sweat.
Permission granted.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
Life is waiting.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
Dr. Homer Wells.
You cook very well!
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
Really?
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Okay...
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Nothing.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
I can't go nowhere.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
It's okay--I don't mind.
Actually, I volunteered.
I guess so...
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Yes, for both.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
It look nicer then home!
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
What view?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
Tough day?
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
And you have this letter of intent?
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Gee... What makes you say that?
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
It's not true.
After you cut her loose.
Guess so.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
How's that? He works for Gillette.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
We'll use the Euc.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
No. Just confidence.
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Very much so.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Don't worry about it.
What?
Then show me how.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Uh-huh.
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Intuition.
Don't ruin this for me.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
What about what?
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
You sure?
Do you have a ticket?
With identification.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
What do you get out of it?
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
To who?
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
High five.
Is it that bad?
Maybe another time.
What are you talking about?
What's the Blue Book price?
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Habib?
Who was he?
Not particularly.
You want me drunk?
I've got a job.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Leave it.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
I hate public transport.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Well, thank you anyway.
First visit to London?
Absolutely not.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
I can't do it, Jani.
Wait a minute...
No thank you.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
Good call. Help yourself.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Rough life, Jack.
I'll tell you later.
I was at Beadles.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Fine.
Does he win?
I can see.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Key?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
All right, then...
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Check at six minutes.
Hey, bomb.
Bomb?
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
That is correct.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
I have no proof that it was false data.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Doolittle...
Which one?
Any planets?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Commander Powell is dead.
Fred.
Out where?
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
What was that, Doolittle?
Well, what you might try is --
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
A grand.
It's a rule.
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
I don't want to move away.
But why can't we stay here?
Mommy, I'm scared.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
Whoever that is.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
I won't be staying.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
You did go through my stuff.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
How much do you know?
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
You're also a fool.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
Let go of my hand.
I understand.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Then what?
Nothing on Hannah?
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
How's this about me?
What guys do.  'Nother order.
Pull the cash.
I have sincere eyes.
You're the best, Maxie.
Tell everybody hey.
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
Exactly.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
How'd you get her out of town?
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
I was on call. 
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Yeah, a man's drink...
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Thanks.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Bye.
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
One more time in English.
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
Curly.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Nah. Couldn't be.
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Check.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
I said, I'm sorry!
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
Hello summer detention.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Let's lift up her shirt.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Good morning...
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Like a spear.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
I am so sorry.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Sure.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
Until it withers away.
Will you go with me?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Maybe she's asleep.
What's wrong with you?
Where is she?
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Who's Frank?
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
Do you get to meet Ed?
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Do they know yet?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Grandma Death.
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Why should we care?
He said to follow him.
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
No.  That's stupid.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
I know.
Why?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Yeah.
I was just being honest.
It is a big deal.
What else?
But now you can't go.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
She's right over there.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Really?
Airport Ho-Jo!
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
We was robbed.
You heard me. Where is it?
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Here, have some.
I know.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
Okay. Take her purse.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
All right, then.
The important thing is that we have a winner...
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
Becky was my only shot at state!
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Yeah.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
The king can do to wrong! 
"My dear"...
"My dear President"...
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
I wanna powder my nose...
What's the matter with you?
All right -
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
I can't do it...
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Sure.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
You upstart!
Bah!! 
No... it was a seven letter word.
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
I didn't come here to be insulted.
How lovely.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
Well, these things take time.
And here are my mother and father.
Yes?
What is it?
I'll get my bag.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Shut up!
What do you mean?
I intend to.
He fell.  He falls.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Right... Right.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Yes sir.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
...Yes, Sir.
And what was that, John?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Yes, I think I can.
Well, yes.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I feel much better. Thank you.
What a mess.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Yes.
y-y-yes--
Yes.
Thank you... very much.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Say "Merrick".
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Thank you very much.
Not at all, John.
Good morning.
Yes, John.
Yes.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Yes. John wants it.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
We never went to bed together.
Who?
Why?
I... but I...
What d'you mean?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
That I cannot tell you.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Don't talk nonsense.
What -- rape?
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
You DON'T like it, do you?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
But...
Come on, move it!
I know. I know.
What's it all about?
She got me thinking...
Well, you ARE!
You may need a real Berserk.
What "magic"?
You'll see!
So?
I've got you!
But how could he know... unless...
I will join my grandfather there.
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
I was sitting there.
We haven't got a spare place.
She MUST have a knife or something...
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Over the Edge of the World.
You will wait?
What do we have to do?
Your lord.
That's it!
What are you talking about?
Hang on...
I... I...
What have you got there?
Can't make enough swords!
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
That's right.
Well... I... I thought...
I know, Dad.
Sh!
Dad!
I never do...
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Okay, I guess.
You were not.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Yeah, I got it.
That's okay.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
You know Wilmont?
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
What?
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
You pick it.
I know a man who needs a refill.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
No, not at all.
That's scary sounding.
You didn't say anything about my hair.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Where are you going?
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Really? Is he cute?
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Yeah, like that.
I know.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
yeah?
I love her.
I think she's great.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Tomorrow?
Make love?
I'm nervous, too.
Says you were a bully...
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
I don't know.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Your dried cum.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
That's your look for me.
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Nah, I don't know.
It's a good one all right.
Go.
You love him, don't you?
Do you swear you didn't know?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Is that Nietzsche?
Alexander Pope?
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I have a family, Mary.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
Oh dear.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Just wanted to let you know.
She likes you okay.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Easy come, easy go.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Yep.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
Justin?
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
We'll make it.
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
His peritoneum has ruptured...
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
Start the countdown.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
...you okay?
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Do it.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
If it worked, yes.
The date.
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
I don't know...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Watch me.
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Come again, Skipper?
I just finished drying...
Carbon dioxide?
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
...repeat, we're armed...
He's been past Mars?
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
There's no one here.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
It's cold.
She's not ugly.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Get them back --
How?
I like the sound of that.
Is it safe?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
I'm worried about you.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
He's made a few changes.
Well maybe you should date him.
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
And they're changing into...
That's terrible news...
Ben! Ben!
Ben, are you there?
Right, whatever, have fun.
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Please tell me you go silent too.
And if he's not...?
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Yes, thanks.
Passion.
What? What do you mean you --
That's what we're here to find out.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
Raising the shields.
Oh, I think you already have.
Arnold. What's happening?
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Of course.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
It's the first door on your left!
Manager!!
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Where did you hear that?
Well... it's true.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
I didn't say that.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
No.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
They were left over from the last shift.
Nice to meet you.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
You first.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
I know it's yours.
All right, I take it back.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
All right. Pay attention.
Damone! You come here?
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Really.
Chicken!
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
And they don't call my parents?
I've been swimming, Merv.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
That's me, Merv.
Totally.
Then don't hassle it.
All right.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
What variables?
What's the big deal?
There's nothing to it.
It was nice.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
What?
What do you want?
He's not coming.
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
You're gonna flunk me?!
Thanks. So do you.
What about those other guys you live with?
Not at all.
Two more Cokes.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Do you really have to go?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Righto!
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Tell me. What do you want?
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
WHAT?
Dobermans don't talk.
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
Really?
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Right!
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Nobody. I'm the maid!
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
You and a lot of other people.
We can't risk letting them in.
We're going to get my little girl.
C'mon guys--
Come on, come on.
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
And the rest of 'em?
Easy.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
Fuck you too.
No. You?
Who's with me?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Yep.
What?
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
But not flush against the tunnel?
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
What?
He shot you the other time.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Get outta here.
No bullshit.
If he doesn't shut up...
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
I'm not lying.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Putting on my armor.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
He knows, Frances.
GET OUT!
You want his name?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Thank you.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
No. Never.
And you think it's worth all this?
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
Always. Always.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Are you really serious? About acting?
...Not if I can help it.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Why, you... you little bastard!
You think I'd miss it?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
I know.
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
That's right.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
No. To thoroughbreds.
I love you too, Frances.
Yeah. I don't know.
Why do you say that?
Just a little way.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
Who's writing this guy's lines?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Your big speech?
Mama, what's...
You're taking me home!
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
I'll be back.
Sure.
Yes, Mama.
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
Sedate her.
No! No!
You're kidding.
Yes. Very close
You speak.
I see it before me.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
Materials. Nothing more.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
She's not for you.
There, there... shhh...
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Fine.
Nothing can. Not ever.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
The world is a dizzying place.
I'll have to do better than that.
All my life I've known.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Aye, Captain.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Oh God.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
I resent God's monopoly.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
I've been preoccupied.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Good night, Brenda.
Sure.
You okay?
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
Absolutely.
I'll go take a look.
I meant everything.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
I need you so much, Claudette.
Here we go.
Get behind him more.
I don't believe you...
God, but I love that sexy talk.
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
I got to.
One night on the town.
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
Just my son and I.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
The truth hurts.
I have no idea.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
Thank you, son.
In heaven.
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You won't let him touch her?
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Anytime.
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Six-fifty.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
Feels good.
Yes.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
Or what?
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
That's what you look like.
Yeah.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
He needs our help!
That's what I hear.
I've been accused of that wish.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Your prerogative, Senator.
No, sir.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
No problem, sir!
Entering my scan now...
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Sounds familiar.
Absolutely not.
What changed?
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
'Snot me.  It's him.
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Yeah.  Me too.
Well, now I feel so much better.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
They had to kill 'em?
That's a good story.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I think you look beautiful.
Sure, sure.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Should I be afraid?
I think you're the liar.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Your new roommate.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
O'Neil, Jordan.
The first female President?
I don't know.  Seems...
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Oh yes he will.
You must have quite some harem.
What?
Yeah, well...
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Oh my God! They're coming!
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
Nick Tatopoulos.
That's the problem. He did.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Five bucks.
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
What?
I don't think so.
They are with me!
You're fast.
It's Tatopoulos.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
That's right.
Sounds like a big company.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Why are you telling this to me?
Why do you need that?
You were right.
Good idea.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
It's Raymond.
Thanks.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
...Damn you!  Damn you!
I had the shot...
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
Oh can't I? Watch me!
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Nobody was WATCHING?
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
What's  your name, son?
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Up.
The enemy is matching velocity.
All systems are working, Commander.
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
Something BAD happened here.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Where'd they go? Back inside?
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
JASON...
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Don't be ridiculous.
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Because it was on the show!
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
You are so full of shit
I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
Closer?  I can try.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
But...Why?
And determination.
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Because they're coming right at us.
They always say that.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
It is.
While they're strung out?
Yes, general?
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Lafayette will not be happy...
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Delighted, sir.
We better, Congress invented him.
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
To hell with Arnold...
Yes, I believe so.
But it's more than just that, am I right?
You invented this, this...
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
We already have black soldiers in our army...
I... they look both the same.
I rode here, on my horse.
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
I think I heard that.
What else?  From Virginia?
We're leaving them?
Yessir!
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
I'd throw everything away for you.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
No. What's this?
So you didn't have the key with you.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
Not too bad.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
I don't believe this.
Bear, you're not really gonna –-
You serious?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
Okay. So who are you?
Who?
That's correct. Look at me.
He owes me money.
I'm in the movie business.
Not yet. I just started.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Where you been, Harry?
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Who?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
One of mine?
With what? Wiseguy money?
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Martin, look at me.
I believe it.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
And you think the movie business is any different?
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
Depends, who pays?
You thought I was faking?
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
I'm going into the movie business.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Pick 'n' Save.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
You seem to feel fine about it.
Be quiet and listen.
Oh, yeah, sure.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
What money?
Really.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey –-  This your ride, Chili?
And after all, you have such morals.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Why not.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Or uninvited guests.
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
Oh yeah.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
Hard to say.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Murphy.
What is it?
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
Don't lie to me!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
If money can buy what he wants.
I bet you did.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Yeah. Thanks.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Yup.
Doesn't matter.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Not our mystery guest again.
Showing you what?
What's that supposed to mean?
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
What do you say, Dodge?
Alright. I'll be right up.
Sorry.
Yeah.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Fifteen, at the most.
Who?
Not the Maxine?
Nothing.
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Yeah, I heard about that.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
But I was only trying to be friendly...
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
Why?
Then why do you hate me so much?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Good.
Just look at them!
We should follow them!
Oh yeah.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
I can't believe it!
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
What, is she black now?
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
It's always closed...
Let's go hassle Josh.
As always.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Which one?
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Don't worry.
What thing?
He came into work.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
It just came yesterday...
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
That's okay...
Where did you get those pants?
Did you bring that tape?
I did too!
Well why do I care about that?
A dollar seventy-five.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Watch my stuff.
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Jesus!
PLEASE? We have to!
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Hooray for me.
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Are you okay?
That's the spirit!
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
YAAA!
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
And you like them?
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
In whatever way you think I mean.
Can you at least let me in?
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
But, I...
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Yeah.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
I don't know... where is she, then?
Why? What did she tell you?
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
As are they all.
Am I to take it you want to live?
How; we don't know where they are?
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Then why do you stay?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
What if there are complications?-
That is correct.  Nothing.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Does he speak English?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
What?
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Has it ever done that before?
Have you ever failed?
What happened to them?
Don't they have to be?...
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
I have to ask- why do you need me?
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Does he ever mention me?
Certainly.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
Okay, let's take a look.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Same difference.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
What are you doing up here?
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
I know.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
I knew that.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."
Huh?  What?
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
Ummm -- figure eight?
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Well, let's check it out.
All right.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
I want you inside me.
Talk to my accountant. 
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Thank you.
What calls?
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yes.  I don't like this.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Oh, shit!
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
We'd better adjust our streams.
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
What do we do now?
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
No sense worrying about it now.
Where are you, Pete?
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
Well, that ought to do it.
Mmmhmmm.
Judgement Day ...
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
You're coming back?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Yes?  Go on!
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
You flatter me, Caesar.
Caesar?
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
On what charge?
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
I don't know...
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
You're hearing about somebody else.
You don't know how wrong you are.
Yours will do!
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
So I understand.
Tomorrow?
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
My troops don't make policy.
I can't let you do that.
Greeks?
They're studying with Cynics.
Let him trust Quintus.
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
Don't be ridiculous.
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
No.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Come in.
Because -- I am.
You've got to tell me what she said.
Because it isn't true.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
If you want.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
I don't know.
I don't understand.
Carl who?
No.
Hello -- who is this?
Is the doctor anywhere?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Who screamed?
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
You heard me. Out of here.
Because I don't like you.
I want you out of here.
Yes.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Could you bring it up?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
What? No. Nothing.
It's down the hall.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
That's right.
What?
Right.
What?
But it's light in there now.
Why not?
When is he coming back?
What do you mean?
What?
Pardon?
Well I don't know.
Will you unzip my dress?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
I know that. But I'm --
What if he did?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Would you like me to seduce you?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I've got to go.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Waiter!
What?
Benjamin.
The number.
What?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Are you tired of it?
No.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Yes I do.
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
No.
See if you can guess.
Don't tell Elaine.
Art.
Kind of.
I don't think we were the first.
What?
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
But why shouldn't I?
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
I wouldn't know.
Now don't start this.
You wouldn't.
If that's how you feel --
You don't have to say that.
Thank you.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I'll find her.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
When I go off?
Goodnight.
No -- they don't.
We haven't.
About what?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
How long have we known each other now?
Yes, sir.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
They are?  Come on.
Splendid!
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
Not now.
The pearls are in her room.
What about the money?
Not with strangers.
Oh -- work!!
Free --
All right. We'll dance.
For tonight. 
Why do you hide in my room?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
So alone.
You are beautiful!
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
Oh -- 
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Shall I see you again?
When are you leaving Berlin?
For Vienna?
Don't.
Bless you --
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
I thought she was splendid!
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I must have made a mistake.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
No, Doctor.
No, doctor.
You're tired. I can see that.
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
The Grand Hotel.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Everything?
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Oh -- what -- what -- 
Oh yes, of course.
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
I'm the stenographer.
Movies?
I got ten marks for that.
Me.
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
A thousand marks -- 
Oh, yes.
Exactly.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Oh -- but it can't be.
I could not think of not accepting.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
-- We must do something...
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Bobo, no, I --
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
I will. So long, Bobo.
Hah.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
Goody!
We're not really interested, Henry.
Henry, no!
Can't move.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
What? He's going to be all right!
You know who I work for.
I know.
Hello.
Roy Dillon.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
I guess I owe you my life.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
I pay my debts.
I know you do, so that's why --
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
What?
In your other hand.
That's just Lilly's way.
Every day in every way.
I'll sign that affidavit.
You already went back to work.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
What happened to Cole?
Where?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
I saw her.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
No! Because I --
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Not many.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
The cemetery...
Doesn't look good.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
And miss the big game?  No way.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
I know.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Will, sit down...
I was trying to protect you from this...
Just get on the bus.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Why not?
Can I come in?
Looks great.  It does.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
You're right.  It does sound strange.
Yeah.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
But I've seen him!
He says things.  Bad things.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I promise.
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
Who are you?
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Wait a minute ...
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
Samhain.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
I dunno, boy.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
You know what gets me?
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
Go home!
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
I dunno.
What's this?
Maybe it's time you got out.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
I've considered that.
What?
For what?
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
What's good about that?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
Go on.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
Mhravitch.
Sir?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
They're not engaged.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Sir?
Will you go to bed?
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
No.
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
Give us time.
We thought a doctor might help.
We thought it was an emergency.
Shouldn't you lie down?
Nothing would please me more.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
I did?
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
No you're not!
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Almost a Christmas scene.
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
If he thinks he's man enough.
What a handsome word.
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Ooops.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
He's dead, you know.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
I've never heard of it.
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
Now who's being cruel?
Comical?
I'm high as a kite.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
More clowning!  Don't you see?
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
If you want to be found that way.
I've enjoyed being man.
It's trash now, like mine.
You don't know?
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
Premature ejaculation.
I don't care what she wears.
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
What a relief!
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's alive!
Still lives with his mother.
It's beautiful.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Who have you been talking to?
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
Keeps fairies away!
He isn't any friend of Father.
Doing what?
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
Take plenty of cigars.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
What?
It is?
As long as he keeps out of the park.
That's the XKE.
It's suicide!
We've got to rescue him.
He's not your son.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Not true.
Penelope!  We're late!
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
Yes, we do.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
No.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
But is she, has...
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Do you want to take a session?
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
How many weeks?
Okay.
Sam?
Overpowering?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
You know her?
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
I am.
What rate?
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
But it's all you do.
He deals in pain.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
You really believe all that?
I thought I was fucked up.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
What makes you so sure?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
...What do you have to offer?
Yeah.
What are you paying me for?
That's like a stag film.
They are?
Hmm.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
What's it called?
But the police...
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
What plan?
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Where does he hang out?
No.
I want to meet Ratan.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Who's that?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Harold Chasen.
Nice to meet you.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Oh.
Promise?
Eh, fine.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
That's really great.
Certainly a new experience for me.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Because they are all the same.
But what?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Look, the ice is melting.
Well, I really don't drink...
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
What was that?
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Well, they're my species.
I took them out.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold. 
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
Can't complain.
No. My uncle.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
You think so, sir?
Well, I don't...
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
It certainly is.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
WHY?
What are you talking...
It's been Hell.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Red, I found something --
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
No. It was red. Bright red.
I think that is its hand.
I thought you liked being on TV.
Me?? C'mon --
Is it bad?
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Who?!
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
I can live with that.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Oh-n-no -- I --
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Hostage negotiations.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Alone?
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
What?
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Sure.
Uh-huh.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
You did this before, right?
No. That wasn't the deal.
No.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
One last time. Give me the box.
I don't want to see the dress.
Who are you?
Ssh!
You're still afraid.
Yes. They'll never find us.
There's very little I can do about it.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
The keys are in the kitchen.
It's just been empty a while.
No. I'm not.
So what's the argument?
Oh Christ. Julia...
I hear you.
I cut myself.
Are you O.K.?
I don't know where to begin...
That depends.
I... suppose so, yes.
Do you care ?
That's right.
Yeah, why don't I?
Try me.
Daddy?
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
You like?
Finished?
It's late.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
We walk.
She's so damn... English.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
What things?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
I beg your pardon?
What's next?
Say it.
Oh, so what's the point then?
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
What the fuck is that?
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
So?  You even said they're good.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
I have a television.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Nothing.
You can be and are wrong.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Pardon me?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Do it.  Do it.
Think about it, Rob.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
You really believe that?
I don't know.
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
Nevermind.
Is what better?  Better than what?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Will you please just go?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
I don't have your number.
You do, huh.
It's me.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Is that the last of it?
It was kind of funny.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Hey, how ya doin'?
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
Mmnn.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Hi.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Okay.
To make you feel better.
No, but...
Harder.
Wanna go to dinner?
WHAT?
Not really.
I'm going to talk to you.
I mean it.
Not in love, exactly, but...
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Well she --
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Good.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
I'm sure it isn't.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
Sixty.
Seventy-five.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Nice.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Go to hell.
I don't follow you.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Where?
Not your concern.
That bothers you?
You?
You are being foolish.
You are.  Now.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
A factor of age.
That would be difficult to explain.
Is that a threat?
Will I see you again?
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
You have lived forever.
I'm just curious.
Now there's a new topic.
Thanks.
What do you want from me?
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
You're a long way from Inverness.
You know me home.  Me name.
This is madness!
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
I do not think I like the sound of that.
But I did live.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
Romirez is dust.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
It can be different.  It must be.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
And the Bulgarian?
Kahn?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
You were never a kid.
Of sorts.
Yes.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
American.
Your murder weapon?
Same.
I'm sure that's true.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Open this door!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
I'm sure you haven't any.
The Criminal Courts Building.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Thank you.
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Oh.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
No. My mother.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
How?
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
You bet I've got a better offer.
I know, Walter, but I --
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
You -- you --
No!
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
What's his line?
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
No kidding?
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
We're not interested.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
I know, but --
I'd like to think.
Where's some paper?
All right, Walter.
Where's Bruce?
You been in a fight?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Will you come here?
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
What is it? Here!
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
I don't know what to do, Walter.
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Walter, you can't do that!
You -- you!!
You know you did!
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
I'll have it in a minute.
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Now, where is he?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Fred!
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
Go on -- shoot me!
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
And up a dime.
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
That's good.
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
What are your beliefs, Earl?
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Put down that gun, Earl.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
Wait a minute, Mollie.
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Never mind! Just play dead.
Shut up, you!
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
The what?
No, I don't think so.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
You're insane!
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
Come on, fellas.
We want to see you.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
Very well, Grandpa.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
They're not.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Ask her yourself.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
...and four and five...
...and six...
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
It's like telling fibs.
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Air-raid?
I don't know?
Please yourself.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
What's that?
Fair enough.  The river.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Father, that's enough now
Really, that's a long time.
Yikes.
OK.
OK.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
You're welcome.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
Fucking great.
Great story Goober, how much?
Holy crap, thanks!
Hey, wait take this.
I don't drive cross country.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
I don't know.
Cat fight, cat fight.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Where ya headed?
There's not enough room.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
That's nice.
How's he get around out here?
Oh.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Yep, I suppose it is.
You find something, Georgie?
Keys.
Huh?
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Firefly.
Huh?
Sorry.
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Who's your Daddy!
Fit the profile?
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
That's it?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
Aw, fuck.
Right...  ...come on.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Oui, doctor, oui.
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Not at all.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Stop. Get away.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Urgh.
Hi. It's Nathan.
I just want to talk.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
Okay.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Very well.
But I like being human now.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
What do you mean?
Won't he be able to tell?
One night stand?
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Nathan told my brother.
Ready!
Where?
You are a therapist, right?
I'm not sure.
No biggie.
That's a great idea.
Terrific. Can't wait!
Fifteen.
Absolutely.
He looks perfectly fine.
What?
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
No.
I'm just preoccupied.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Such as what womanly things?
I had sold my fucking soul.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Yahoo!
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Yep.
Mm hmm.
Next game, ten bucks.
You want a chaser?
Check!
No, I'm fine.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
Do we need words?
You know what's good for him?
Thank you.
That's the way it's done.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
It's possible.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
I got drunk.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Hi. How's business?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
You hustlin' me?
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
All right. Five hundred.
How're the hands?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
I asked around.
A son.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
Aw, Eddie.
Would you like to come out tonight?
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Ten dollars.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Yes.
Eight o'clock.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Around.
I used to be an actress.
Come here.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
You told me.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Haven't you opened it?
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Me. It's Eddie.
You wanna drink?
What's it so hot in here for?
Is that what makes a winner?
Come here. Come on, now.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Why?
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
You watch me.
Thousand dollars a game.
Let's go.
You lived like this once.
With them?
Yes.
You're not them.
Have you looked inside?
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
Virginia...?
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
Round back.
Yes.
Do we have to?
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
Okay.
What, Jim, what?
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
Good night.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
About what?
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
But it's not, Jimmy.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
The back door was open.
What?
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
He's not going to listen to me.
He's a good man.
More than likely.
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
Checkmate.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Just getting a feel for her.
I can't shake her free.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
She should be shortly.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Yes, Sir.
Better than we thought.
But what, General?
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Yes, I am.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
I'm a dancer.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
Above American soil?
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Air... water... your "sun."
Peace? No peace.
Die.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
All your life.
It looks like a converted church.
Dad was onto something here!
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Are you sure?
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
How do you know?
So it did.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
Out!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
Right.
Yeah?
Will you take it easy!
So did I.
What?
And do I detect a rebuke?
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
I know, Dad!
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
Ready.
No.
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
Miss Scott panicked?
Finally!
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
There are no stories anymore.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Okay, Shorty.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
Just a statue.
Why?
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
What evil?
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Oh yeah?
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
Just one arm!
Oh really?
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
Maybe he likes older women.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Yes, they believe you.
No... they won't kill me.
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
And they don't even know what it really is.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
I know you did!
What's going on?
Yes?
What is your name?
Why don't we go home?
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
That a new Datsun?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
I just went there for a job.
Kill myself.
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
I am. You are.
You gotta help.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
What does it say.
Who did?
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
I'm at the airport.
We get on a plane.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Just get there.
Eat it.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
What? What do you mean?
What was?
...Rene...
To the hotel. To register.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
This...is not going to work out.
That place. By the window.
Who, me?
What glasses.
I don't know what's going on.
How do you know?
Not her. You!
It's not your time. I get time off.
Osaka?
I can't keep up.
That's not funny.
Too late.
Drink lots of water.
I can't see a thing.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Come on.
While he makes the run.
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
What exactly?
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Yeah, sure.
You're lovely.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
It's all we've got.
I insist.
Don't worry.
Who's our little man?
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
He work for us?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
I have a new client.
We insist.
Do what?
Who...are you?
How do I look?
Oh.
Oh yeah, thanks...
I don't know Who.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Just give me the keys.
Sir?
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
Yes?
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
Do what?
Like there's someone else here.
I just work for the travel firm.
Me still. They left you alone?
That you're not crazy.
Why do you do it?
You're doing...Okay.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
They left. I had to go with them.
You seemed interesting.
Last night?
No, he didn't do that.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
He must be a good friend.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Ryuji and Gruner.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Hong Kong.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
You've  been there?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
That I really don't know.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Why did you, then?
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
What?
I've never met anyone like you.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Why'd you invite me here?
Thanks.
Tear it apart?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Okay.
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
Lowell?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Sure. Where?
I'll be there.
What? Forget it.
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
Okay. 
No, no, we're fine...
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
You're sure you want to do this?
I'm doing an interview.
What's the difference...
Who's calling?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
Jeffrey...
Get some perspective, Lowell.
...you fucked me!
That's right...
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
What?
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
You charge by the hour?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
I heard.
Yeah, great.
What does this have to do with my testimony?
I told the truth... I told the truth.
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
What?
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Liane has filed for divorce...
You're gonna get your fix...
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
That's why we hire scientists...
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Howard!
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Mr. Dumbarton.
Set one side for Bel Air.
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
Why do you think she did it?
I said yes.
Gotcha.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Absolutely.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
But why him?
Howard is a beautiful person.
Have you tried the duck?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
Thank you.
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
What is it Miles?
Huh?
Yes.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
I bet.
What do you want?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
Meaning my house.
You have to leave the house immediately!
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
It's not something I wanted either.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Forgery? Fraud?
My whole metabolism is -- off.
You have some?
Jesus.
She did a Harriman.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
I wish I had your discipline.
Well what does he want?
Shit.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Hello Miles.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
Oh brother. Here we go.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
We've outlined a settlement...
That's her job. You have to respect that.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
I don't know. I can assume...
She brought my digestive enzymes.
I am very sorry.
HA!
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
Maybe next time.
Why—uh—she's all right, sir.
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if—
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
Oh, yes. I heard.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
I suppose so.
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
Yes, of course.
Amateurs!
But the lady says—
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
You win!
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
Why, you ungrateful brat!
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
What are you talking about?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You must have me confused with—
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Shut up!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Oh, this?—I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
What's the matter?
I don't trust that chatterbox.
What do you mean—starvation?
Of course it is.
Yes.
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
was so scared—that it scared—
Raw?
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Come here, you little fool!
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Not interested. 
Left twenty minutes ago.
Oh, excuse me. 
Well, I'll be—
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn—then something comes along—messes up the finish—and there you are.
When you sober up—come in and see me.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
I dunno.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is—"  No, do you really?
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
There's a seat over there for you.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Huh?
Why—no—
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
No.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Keep saying what?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Yeah.
I did.
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
No, I did not.
Dave?
What did they...
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
What was so appealing about Houston?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
A Perry Russo?
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
Tough day.
What?
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
Between six and seven seconds.
How many men?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
We need him back.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Yes.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
...and your General?
More than ten years.
Never touched me.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
And Oswald?
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
She's the best damn witness we have!
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
Uh huh.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
A bit.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
She wants to go back to work.
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
Sure.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Can I see your I.D.?
I am, as a matter of fact.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Ordell pick up his bond?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
It was the other guy who busted me.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
How many trips did you make?
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
I am. Have a seat.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Sure.
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
You're not old. You look great.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
They seem to like the idea.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
When did you decide?
More or less.
What if I've figured a way?
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
In the bag underneath.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
Spain.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
Can I smoke?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
What are you doing?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
Not in the fitting room.
I thought you were watching him.
Do you think I took some of that money?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Gimme one anyway.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Dreaming.
Keep it between us girls?
Sure.
They asked.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Baby, I didn't --
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
Who?
So we need two people, two women.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
I can do that.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
She don't know shit about the money.
Sure.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
The roller disco one.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
No.
Must of made quite an impression.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Yeah, down the end.
This one.
That's good money.
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Yep.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
What does that mean?
You said five hundred and fifty!
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Livingston, huh?
Hear what?
What does she do for you?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
You know it's for you.
Give me his home number.
Where do you want to go?
What isn't happening?
Just to see you. That's all.
Hello, Sam.
No, don't. But thanks.
Stop!!!!
It's short, huh?
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
That's right. We did.
There's nothing to expose.
It was the window.
Tell your mother.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Why do you say that?
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
But I see them.
Carlson? Is he new here?
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
It's freezing.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
I don't want to know.
Go to sleep.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Save me!
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
Don't ask.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
I don't let anybody call me that.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Why do you bring her up?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
Get your clothes off!
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Coming here?
Lie down!
Are we in Brooklyn?
What?
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
Why didn't you call me?
Let go!
Stay away from me, Jez.
I can do anything I want.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Sit down.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
You've lived with me for two years.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
You know who I am.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
What is it?
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Hot. Where do I sign?
Push 'em back.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Where am I?
Of course it is. What else could it be?
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Nope.
What's goin' on Paul?
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Alright, asshole.
What do you mean, not enough time?
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
No.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Where'd you get the gun?
Let's move out!
Thorgan, suit up.
We could convert fission transistors.
I don't know!
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
And now we're all out of it.
Suit up.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
You got that right.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
What?
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Fuckin A...
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
I'm pulling, damnit!
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
Not so bad.
Okay, good tip.
I'm stuck!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
Old woman?
No shit. I got no problem with that.
He's right behind us!
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
You're leaving me here alone?
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
No! He's coming with us!
Keep trying!
What?!!
But?!!
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
It's okay.
My boat's neat, dad!
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Michael! Come inside!
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
Can you do that?
No. Home here.
Do I need any more authority?
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
Why?
Who are you?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
Rogue?
Chum?
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
They must've hit something.
That means closing the beaches.
I wish it would rain...
It's a whale out there.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Just keep kicking.
I didn't know her.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Is anyone having this...?
This is Quint, Missus.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
Let it go, don't waste your time.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
Thanks for the message.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Huh?
Yeah. That was me.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Yup.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
No... I guess not.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
You're something else.
Why? What the big deal?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Really? Fingernails?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
I am a suicide risk.
Unfortunately, yes.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Share the love, Tits!
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
You sound shocked or something.
Right, seriously.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Yeah, downtown.
...I said, I like your hair.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
...Yeah.
Not really.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
How'd you meet Early?
Sure.
Took 'em all.
Do what?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
What's Early been in jail for?
...Anything else?
That's not true!
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
Turkey mostly.
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
How much do I owe you?
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
...Then some.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
...just like that?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
I don't know.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
Where's Adele?
No, never. Excuse me.
Everybody just shut up!
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
...You're hurting me...
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
You fucked it?
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Yeah.
What do you want?
You think he's got any herb?
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
Yep.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
Yep.
Who?
Oh. You like her?
Darcy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bet.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Shut the fuck up.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Hold up man.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Na.
Yeah. Do it again.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Right now?
You have?
Yeah. I can understand that.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
How do you know?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
No, Fidget, I...
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
You're OK?
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
No.
Yeah?
It's like...
Yeah.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Yeah.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
What?!
I don't know, eight or nine.
Yep.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
OK.
What are you saying?
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
What?
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
Sanderson?
It's a voice modulator.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Did anyone stand out?
What was suspicious about him?
You're not going to tell me that.
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Set up some pieces on the big board?
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Why did he what?
You're losing me.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
Thanks, David.
For what?
Who's Kathy?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Yeah.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
We're not sure.
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
I want to be the best I can.
Just thought you might want to talk.
No.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
It's alright.
When I was very young.
It is.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
Then why are you backing up?
For emphasis?
What?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
I got lucky.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Thank you, but I can wait.
Colwyn.
I won't leave you here.
Turold's son was to marry her.
What do you see?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
I'm not sure.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Yes.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
He saved our lives.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
You can have half.
I ...  ... am Titch.
I only want one.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
That I am, my lady.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
The Widow of the Web?
Fewer will survive them.
That is true.
Ynyr!
We had no children.
Of what?
Why must you know?
Yeah... How do you know it?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
You were scared, weren't you?
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
I never rent my gear.
Mathilda?!
...17.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
...Don't you like me?
...I don't know.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Fine...
Huh?
...And how much is it?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Where?
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
I'll kill you!
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
We can do it together.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
Show me.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Don't be so sure.
He's plastered.
No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Not our problem.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Making the grand total?
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
Walking where?
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
I do.
Steph.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
What?  Who are you?
Evening News?
No.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
You do?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Don't be silly?
No?
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
When?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
Yes.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
It's me, Yuri.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
Get up.
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Thank you!
Is everything okay?
Thank you.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
See?
Aristotle.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Definitely! I love him!
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
I'm so happy for you!
Really?
What?
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
You guys are so sweet!
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
So?
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
No way --
I will...
Neat.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Is he the only one?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
Where's Warner?
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Thank you. Having fun?
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Three months.
Chuck.
Why do you say that?
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Always.
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
What do you want with me?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
But I'm hideous!
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
To be my bride, of course.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Who might these friends be?
What does she want from me?
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Will you lead me to her?
And if she thinks me a liar?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
And who might that be?
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
Something's coming.
Careful, lad.
Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Jack, don't!
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
There's the way, mates.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
No... but what choice have we?
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Will you chance a miss?
That's it!
It's what we'll find there worries me.
The wound is mortal.
Mean you to seek him out below?
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
And did you?
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Stop complaining.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
I'll go search for it.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
You've freed me, Jack...
And I... love you...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Is she fair, this princess?
As fair as me?
Dead, dead, dead.
You'll visit again?
I pray God grants it me.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
And sweet?
You... you... you mortal you!
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
Up ahead!
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
It's done... we'll never catch him.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
The Black Baron, you say?
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
You follow.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
He was there and then he wasn't!
We can work.
Since seventh grade.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
It's so beautiful.
Mom said I should.
Who are you?
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
Uh...using Josh like that.
Who are all these people?
I'll survive.
No.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
I don't know.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
Why?
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
Does everything have to have a point?
I'm not gay.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
It would help me if I could kiss you.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
Okay.  I guess.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Not if what he left me was real.
Floating to Catalina.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
We've known each other since grade school.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
A violation?
A sink?
Months.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
For everything.
Yes, it is.
I'm sorry.
Not a shower.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
Thank you.
No I'm not!
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'll get your bag.
Goodnight.
Why?
You're so predictable.
It'll be fine.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
Oh, okay.
Hi, Mom.
I know.  Why?
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
What do you know about me?
To hide a black eye.
Yes.
Here.
I'd build a house.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
Thanks for telling me.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
Why does he have a lock on his door?
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
What did you do with your dog?
Why call me?
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
I'm married.
I can't leave the house?
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
What have you been before today?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
I smiled at him.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I'd rather you not be here.
What did I say?
That was the truth.
I can't pick you up.
You bit my finger.
I need to know.
Left you?
So could I.
I could use the money.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
We should take a vacation.
What?
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
You can't go because of Sam?
I never asked for more.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
Either do you.
Do you like red?
It's not ours.  It's George's.
Yeah.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
Why?
What did you say?
Someone stop her!
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
Then what's the problem?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
I don't think so.
Claude Banks.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
You need collateral.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
That jelly you were talking to right here?
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
What about you, Radio?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
So?
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
What do you want, Claude?
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
I'm stuck!
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
Him?
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
I'm not working on a plan.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Go where, Ray?
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
'Course I was right. About what?
So?
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
You killed Santa Claus?
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
You heard the boss! Let's move!
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
What were they, bootleggers?
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
It'll be too late.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Are you offering me a bribe?
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Something like that, yes.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
Me? Willie Long.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Understood.
Let her go.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Don't do it!
Noon...
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
Urr... uggg... errr...
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
Yeah, you do...
It would be so okay.
You're already there...
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
What can I do about it?
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
That's a pretty brassiere.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
It's Stanley, sir.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
By she, do you mean he?
The Dark Prince is here.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Peppermint... alright.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
Really?
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
"Octopus people?"
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
School?
Sometimes, sure.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
What are you doing?
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
That was Cassius!
I love you.
I don't know?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
All right -- what are you?
Anything to eat?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Only a few? You're just not trying.
I'm in my party mood.
Anybody we know?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
No.
How a Sandman lives.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I don't have much time.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
I won't.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
Of course.
It could be...
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
Yes...
I don't know.
No.
I don't know... but it does.
At least it's over...
Where are you going?
Oh, my...
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
For as long as I can remember.
Gracious... no.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
It's me...
I can't see you tonight.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Me, too.
So what do we do?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Okay.
Why are ya goin' so early?
We killed him.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
No.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
Pete, what happened to you?
He won't give his name.
I don't know yet.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
But my head...
That's absurd.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
Called? When?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Just a minute.
What job?
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
I can see that.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Sorry... I...
Sure. Sure I do.
It was weird...
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
Thank you.
Yes.
Well, what do you know about that!
Good morning—
It certainly is.
Oh, really?
Now you're irritating and absurd!
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
And be poisoned out here in the open?
Come on, Lovey.
Gold. You were going to—
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
Leaving?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Thank you.
Who, for instance?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
You're startled?
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
The only one.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
No.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Splendid!
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Father Perrault is dead.
What is it, my son?
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
Yes.
Yes, Bob.
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
What do you mean if we should get out?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Let me go, Bob!
Why - I'm sorry - but I—
I don't see that there's anything to say.
You can't leave, George.
So you think I'm mad?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
She's going with me.
What was that?
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
That was easy. I read your books.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
You see, it's not a dream.
Why?
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
What the hell...
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Actually, sir--
I'd go with number three.
Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
We wear black.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
Get back in the car!
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
Actually... I don't know.
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
You're not taking me in!
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Actually, yeah--
How'd you know that?  Kay?
They're not my pals--
I wanna make a deal.
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
Dee?  What are you doing here?
They went right to the President.
Where's he making his big speech?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
Can you see?
Agatha...
He'll turn around.
Please --
Someplace safe.
She died?
Oh, Jesus...
That's comforting.
Right.  I know --
Yeah --
Yes, you did.
How do I find the --
I can't even stand up --
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Don't worry, Lamar.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
I understand.  What's the other thing?
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Sir?
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Because it was going to fall.
Yes.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
It helps if you don't think of them as human.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Oh... Hi, John.
That's right.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
What a big boy.  How old are you?
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Once I even told him I loved him.
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
The precogs were wrong.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
I'm a little dizzy...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
You say some of the children died?
Not if I stay away from him.
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Lamar --
Not.  Now.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
He's my subordinate!
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Yes.
I wanna kill my boss.
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
We can stop him.
Who?
I know who you are.
To what?  Trap him?
What are you talking about?
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Snifter are for warm drinks --
We have snifters
Where's the place to go tonight?
He's okay.
He's alright.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
What time is it there?
I love you. Come home.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
What'd you say?
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
I don't get it.
Draw.
5-5-1.
Yeah, sure.
She'll be out in a minute.
Get away from her.
Yeah. Where is he?
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
She was fast, huh?
That's why they call it the smart money.
What?
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Yeah.
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
He's not here.
What are you saying?
So?
Yeah. I know the number.
Then why do you try to get in?
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Fuck him.
What are we delivering?
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
To keep?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Well, I don't want to walk.
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
Nothing.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
What did I 'get?'
Like I said, I don't know.
So we're working?
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
What's up?
We're getting whacked.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
The what?
Did you hear what he just said?
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
Why?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
What do you mean 'kinda?'
Well, come on then. It's back here.
What?
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
A little.
The videos.
Where do you live?
Where do you live?
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
Does anyone want another?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Word.
You'll love it.
Different.
We're square.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
Goodbye.
What?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Man's rep travels.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
Yes, sir.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
What you talking?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
You never had it.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Who are you?
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
Tell Him that.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
If you want to tell me.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
There's nothing to talk about.
How old are you, Betty?
What have you set your mind to?
What do you think?
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I'm tired of praying.
Let's get out of this cold.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
I know where you're going.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
500.
Please make way, please --
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
What's your story, baby?
Tell him about Baldy.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
He told you that?
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
So you are going to talk me to death.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[No!]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[How do I recognize him.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[Lucky how?]
[You stole the drop.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
I drink.
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
I said the plan was right here.
Yes or no?
That's right.
No.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
The gunshot holds no fear.
Still not a question.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
Planned what?
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
It's Creasy.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
[Yes.]
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
What? Who?
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
Two tourists who never went home.
I can take care of myself.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
What?
Which one was that?
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Where?
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
Were the lights on?
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Nothing.
I'll wait for your call.
Nothing.
How do you do?
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
That's the one.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Put on your blue suit...
Marty...
I heard you, Ma.
She didn't look Italian to me.
Hey, Ang'...
Hiya, Ralph...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski – Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
Just one for a start.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
You make a mean martini, kid.
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
When?
Be right with you.
We could steal one of the choppers.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
We're a good team.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
You betcher ass, General.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
No, no, that one.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
What do we do?
That's right. We work well together.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
Thanks.
The one and only.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
You can cut the bow.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
Yes, sir?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Oh, get out of here!
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Morning, Captain.
I can try, sir.
They can't do that to me!
What's that, Henry?
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Me?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Yeah, that's the one.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Thirty dollars.
Money.
No, no, no—that's your seat.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
A third party?
John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Where is she?
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Naw.
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
What Bert's trying to say is—well—we need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goods—a fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Huh? Get what?
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
No.
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Nineteen!
That's too bad.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Yeah.
What?
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
You're my hero.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
Of course.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Huh?
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Automatic.
I what?
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Being faxed over now.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Yeah.
Like it had to be done.
I know.
National Marksman Competition.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
Is there something wrong with that?
Why? You like my ass?
I think I can handle that one.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Okay, stop.
That's okay. That's his style.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
We lost.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
Good question.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Can I come in?
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
Just now.
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
...Let me just show you.
Use your imagination.
Scottie...
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
A deeper level?
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Who's running it?
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
Yes.
True.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
Because I took it out of your memory.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
True.  But why?
In here I am.
One would assume so.
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
-- He will.
At least a day.
What about the customers with reservations?
New York.
There is no --
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
What?
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
Why?
Why would I do that?
Insurance.
Cleaning up a mess.
No.
No.
-- The inside?
I know.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Activated.
Destination?
Checking connection.
-- Waiter.
Resurrection.
Uplink selected.
Speed?
Now tell me... what do you see?
Stylin'!
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
There should be a way to open it.
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
... Let's take a look over there.
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
What's a Triac?
TRICERATOPS!
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
We can take these guys!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
LET'S FLY!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
A real shame.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
Did I say anything?
GO IVAN!!
So they've been destroyed?
How'd you know?
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
And I ain't no nigger either!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
You've got the public upset, Al.
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
But I've never served a day.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Tell me about it.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
Long as Charlie says.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
I must be going.
I needed to see you again.
You're sure?
It's a mask.
London?
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
I told you twenty!
What's your problem?
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
They don't give a shit about us!
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Never threaten me, Boss.
He's trying to make it.
You gotta plan these things.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
They're friends of our enemy.
Not if they all die at once.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
I got partners.
I found that out.
I don't fuck my partners.
They do what I tell 'em.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
I turned him down flat.
We can operate around these guys.
Shuddup.
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Just wanted ta say hello.
Stu Miley.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Why?
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Got a doctor on duty.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
What?
I just need to use the phone, lady.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
What pictures?
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
I can make my own decisions.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
What does he do?
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
This way?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Thanks very much, sonny--
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
Let's send out a pigeon!
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Would you settle for a husband?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Yeah. What about the second act?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
I apologize.
I'll cherish ya.
Is the wind tired out there?
Have *you*?
What?
Why me?
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
How do you feel, champ?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Ma! Hold him!
Oh, a *boy*!
What stuff?
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Mr. President!
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
No.
Nonsense, Jeff.
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Will he *yield*?
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
Mr. President--
No, Jeff--please--!
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
You're a liar!
Office of--Senator Smith?
Most natural thing in the world!
Right.
Some committee's got it.
We're over in the House.
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
Try sitting down.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
Terrible, thank you.
I also answer to whistles.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Don't mention it--
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Saunders--
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Then you *did* say it.
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
A Bill! Not *him*!
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Let's get away from here. 
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Go away, Nosey.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
He's lost complete faith in me--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Do you?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
He did it.
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Deeds?
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Always.
No, no children.
No!
No! I resigned last week!
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, I don't mind.
It's wonderful.
That depends on what they see.
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Had the boys follow us.
Yes.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
A smaller bowl of flowers.
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
This is outrageous!
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
All right.
When?
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Huh?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Nah.
Huh?
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Only common sense.
Entertainment?
Oh.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Arthur wants to quit!
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
Oh. That.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Yes?
Take the stand!
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
Not at all.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Now you keep out of this!
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
I did what!
What two policemen?
Looking for?
Yeah.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
What happened?
Mr. Cook.
What's that?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
A friend?
Not any more.
Ernest, what do you think?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Stop now.
Go to hell.
What?!
Do you want to come in?
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
What do you think's wrong with her?
Yes.
I'd better get in there.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
...so accomplished.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
Sure I can, Lionel.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Don't need it.
You're good.
Is she a friend of yours?
Martin.
Why don't you tell me?
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
Hmm.
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
You like it?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Um-huh.
What was that?
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
It's a big part of the show.
It's called pro bono.
What do you want me to see?
True. Should we stop them?
Uh-huh.
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
Really?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Don't you like this?
Good-looking woman.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Really?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
It wasn't the best situation.
Holy shit!
You were messed up, man.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
You're completely reliable.
What'd I do?
Yep.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Relax, I got him.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
You shall see.
What does he want the book for?
Oh yes, always.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Water turning to blood.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
I would never!
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Who was talking about what?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
And what is that?
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
Yes?
I was mistaken.
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
Um, well, you see...
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
Your mind is so slippery.
Head hunting.
One last tweak.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
I'm his daughter.
When was that?
Do it, big boy!
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Doctor Heller?
Get on to yourself!
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
Captain who?
Really?
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Why?
I just want to be a superhero.
What are you talking about?
And you are a fool.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
He is in love. His anger is gone.
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Oh shut up.
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
Not yet.
Oh hi, Mom.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Mother... it's not what you think!
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
Who are they?
Shut up.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Whatever our name is.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
May the forks be with us!
Through there!
Proceed.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
You could have them here by daybreak.
And where is Joseph?
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir.
A glass of champagne, please.
Yes, I am.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
I very much doubt that he will.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Would you like some brandy?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Lisette.
Lisette La Croix.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
You must not act impetuously.
Well, you shall see.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
No.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
All right -- I promise.
I know what you're doing in there.
Five minutes.
It's me.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
I couldn't face telling you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
That is correct.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
That is a matter of opinion.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Thanks, Unc.
I'm his cousin.
I'll do it.
What happen?
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
What about the dog?
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
I know, be still.
That's the sister.
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
Nothing.
I didn't see nothing.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
I'll remember.
Smokin' what?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
You don't wanna know.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
And some rolling papers.
Bite his ear!
20 minutes?
I got fired too.
I don't know.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
What urgent message?
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
Oooh, ba-by!
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
What's he doing here?
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Huh?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Oh, yeah?
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
No.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
I would also like to apologize.
What?
What's your point?
The gun...
Then I have time for a drink.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
You fucked up.
Keep your voice down.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
That's right. That gives you...
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
Over and out.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
I promise.
No...kisses to you.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
What?
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
What are you going to do?
Hi.
I don't know.
What?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Laughs.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
You're a big girl, huh?
A surprise?
Yeah.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
No.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
She went.
You have all sinned!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
So you ain't with the State no more?
Say what, Walt Spoon!
John don't like him much.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
What!
There! What's so hard about that!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
'Cause you're too little.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
Sshhh...
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
That's Daddy!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Yonder.
Yes?
What secret shall I tell?
What's your name?
All right.
Pearl and John.
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
Our honeymoon.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
What's wrong, John?
None of your business, Madam.
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Haven't slept, have you?
No.
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
No.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
What?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Sure, but...
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
I won't.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Right.
Okay.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
S'curity.
Just sleep now, Mom.
We should get her out of here...
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
He's nuts about you.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Naturally, Comrade.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
And there?
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
That's right... and we might as well face it.
No, that's bad management.
I think I need my glasses.
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
That's all right.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
No, sir.
Yes.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
What did she say about me?
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
Well, we're back home.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
What business?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Oh no. No visa.
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
I'll try.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
That's a strange angle.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
I will do my best.
Yes.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Why?
At what?
Why?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
I promise... I swear.
And General Savitzky.
A funny story?
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
Darling, darling... please!
Comrades! Good people of France!
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
No. Nobody will find us.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
It is their wish.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Good morning, Swana.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Huh?
No.
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
Yes.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Madame, if you...
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Yes, it does.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
Where is that?
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
What?
I like that.  That's a solution.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
Yes ... I got the money.
I'll bet he would.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
I thought the gloves were off.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
And if I stay?
Sir?
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
How is this national security?
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
You never told him?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
Sir?
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
For God's sake, when does this end?!
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Is it my turn?
Thou must.
What about happiness, Mother?
What ... ?
Harold ... can I get you anything?
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
She's quite pretty.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
There's no other choice.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
How a fat man gets so many girls.
Yes, Mr. President.
Looks can be deceiving ...
I was the lesser of two evils.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
You're shittin' me.
Syracuse.
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
I like jazz ...
Yes, I understand that.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
No, sir ...
Well, we could delete it.
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
Do you really want this, Dick?
And then you'll be happy?
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
They were for me.  They're mine.
Lost.
To what?
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
'Predate it.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
Try "old" on for size.
Oh yes.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
That's very linear Sheriff.
Mm.
Gun out and up.
Sheriff?
I don't know. He ought to...
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
I always am.
I never do.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
Well I didn't see it.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
To your husband.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
That'll work.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Yes ma'am?
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I know where it's going to be.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Well -- where ya goin'?
Yeah? Where am I?
No. Do you?
Sixty-nine cent.
I was just passin' the time.
You already asked me that.
You married into it.
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
The kind with the most poles.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
Okay. We can stop that.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
I got beers in my room.
Sugar?
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
I'm retired.
What did I say?
No I don't have it.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
No sir.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Yeah?
Anyway, so what?
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
No, I didn't have to.
That's a nice name for what you need...
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
"Banners?"
Oh. How come?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
"Thirty-two?"
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
This is really awkward...
Oh, Betty --
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
What?
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
No, Del.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
David, please --
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
What?
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Did you love it?
That's horrible!
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
What's his real name?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Man, that is love.
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
He has a wife?!
Who?
You never know who you'll see.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
Where are you going?
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
If we're for real?
I don't follow...
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
IT SURE IS!!
He told us it's in the Buick.
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
...among others.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
I said, 'No.' N-O.
What?
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
What do you mean?
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
You better believe it.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
I'll think about it.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
No! Let me try this!
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
- and share one of your graves.
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
Do not seek the treasure!
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
Where's Tommy?
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
In any state.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
- in the gods - Huh?
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Don't I know it.
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
Aw, that's all right.
But... but...
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
He ain't our daddy!
Blooey!
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
What for?
I joined the Navy.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Pardon?
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Great.
No way... Would you?
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
My kinda group!
He didn't give you much choice.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
I'll get it if you want.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
So?
Why'd he do it?
I can't risk it.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
He said he grew up poor?
I've seen better.
Yeah.
A little.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
But it can't wait.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
God.
That's right.
I have the gun.
Remember that.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Are you gonna open the safe?
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
She better.
This was your department, Junior.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Different tables.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Shut up.
They're gonna die in there!
Hey.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
Yeah, whatever.
I don't get it.
Can we come in?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
No ball, kid.
Not at all.
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
It's just the woman and the kid?
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
Why?
The furniture guy?
That room!
What do they want?
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
No.
I saw something, I saw...
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
What are doing with yours?.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
Yeah, it's me.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Jesus...
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
We're like policing the police.
Yeah.
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Well, act like it. Come on.
Maybe...
If you got something to say, say it.
Bullshit...
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Where is he?.
Why didn't you tell me?
No.
Late summer.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
You couldn't have known.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
Goodbye.
Oh?
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Prisoner exchange.
Yes, sir.
Perhaps.
Probably.
The middle colonies?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Oh?
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
You know what happened.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Harry, Harry, Harry...
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
Balderdash!
Gabriel.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I'm sorry.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
I am, I think.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Four, five miles.
For what?
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Remember Braddock?
Well...I guess not.
Yayyy!
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
You believe in it.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
I don't know.
Your cairn.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
This babe has said enough.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Shit! Look at this mess!
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
Remember.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
It's beautiful!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
And Church will be fine.
Aye, aye, sir!
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
I'll torture it out of you.
What're you suggesting?
That so?
Did you, now?
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Can I trust you?
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Yes -- yes.
Ceremony?
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
Nor did you, I noticed.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
That he is.
What?  He never told me that.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
I don't think that will be necessary.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Pirate.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Aye!  Avast!
Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Where did he come from?
A moment.
Please.
No.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Nebbleman.
That remains to be seen.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
Shut up and do it!
What did he want?
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
The replicators?
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
You're insane.
Susan, this is the future of America here.
Yes.
We don't?
The waste.
Three days ago it was.
You're the doctor.
What about it!
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
No problem.
On the counter.
Where is it?
Yes.
I have to!
We were different people then.
I guess they do.
That's right.
Oh yeah?
The question is, are you?
It's a miracle.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes - Sing Sing.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
How-di-do.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
I'm glad.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Are you crazy?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
You can't walk out of here like this.
Why—
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Mother!
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
Oh, man!
Is that so?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Oh boy, I'd love it.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Yeah?
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
A what?
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
Quite so. Quite.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
It's the smoke.
Not since you broke into society.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Right!
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Conrad.
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
It'll be ready in a minute.
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
And now for that twentieth crack—
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
I beg your pardon?
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Yes, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
Well sir, I'll show you.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Thanks.
Yeah ...  That--and ...
What?
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Sure.
I won't.
Thanks.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
Oh, George ...
Um ... It's ...
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Oh, gosh no.
Why not?
It's better, Mary Sue.
What?
What's the matter?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
No it couldn't!
I'm fine--but thank you.
No. What?
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Thank you very much.
Still doesn't make it right.
Well, I never had to do it before.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Get lost!
What's going to happen?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Nothing.
They don't have that kind of potential.
That's great.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Wow.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Right here.
They just grow like that?
We'll just put up the top.
Sure ...
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Scout?
Nice ... Nice ...
That's right.
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
... Hi.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
No you're not.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
I'm going to leave now.
Just gimme the damn remote!
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
I'm so glad you're here.
... What's that?
I'll never be able to do that.
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Yeah but what are you doing?
And what was this?
This is "Fly With Us?"
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
Somewhere in Utah.
D&D Mattress Man.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Why?
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
No.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
I have work, I can't leave.
It's fine, but --
I feel really on the spot now.
Call me later.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
I....please don't do this.
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
Hi, is this Jack?
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
I'm in my bedroom.
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
You have a girlfriend?
...yeah.....
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Really? Please?
I have to go.
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Ok.
Hi.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
No. Not at all. It's nice.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
It's Barry.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Nothing.
If you come to Hawaii --
You don't think you'll go --
Thank you.
About six months ago. Why?
I think maybe over a hundred.
Yeah.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
You left me at the hospital.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Well who did?
You're hand is bleeding.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Can I ask how much is this?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
I think you have a call?
That was weird. I meant good.
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Hi, Lance.
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Yeah.
Wait a minute --
How much money do you have in your pockets?
You have another house somewhere or something?
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
Are you going to the party tonight?
What are you doing?
Right now, you're doing nothing?
Seriously.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
No.
Should I call you later?
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
Once or twice.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
"Turn you out?"
By whom? The Marquis?
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
That's enough.
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Then it must've been love --
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
His wife's influence.
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
Well...?
Shut down?
Of course.
No. It most certainly was not.
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
Poorly.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Enough!
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
Of course.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
....shame on you, truly...
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
But it's just begun --
Very much.
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Houdini mice.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Do you?
Over at RKO?
Yeah
Yes.
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I will not have this in my home.
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
We're using-
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Can I talk to Hearst?
Telling stories.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Right-
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
I don't wanna write about no spic.
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
I don't give a shit about-
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
Yeah, you're probably right.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
Herman.
Yes.
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
Again
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
The ad..
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
It was fun, wasn't it?
About what?
For what?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Nothing...
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Whadda you care?
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Yeah, she's nice.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
Well, that's what I mean.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
You sound bitter.
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
I just wanted to say hello.
Can you see it?
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Yeah, what?
You're hurting my arm.
What're you talking about?
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
Yeah --
I'm leaving you Jake.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
C'mon, Tommy --
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Excuse me for living.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Jefferies?
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
I was jaywalking.
You figured that out, huh?
Your Lisa?
I told you that --
Like an old hambone?
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Gunnison?
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Did you get my note?
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Well, I only quote from the best.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
I'm not ready for marriage.
She's all right.
I was.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Police?
You called the police?
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
Would four of them -- ?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
There's probably one in the basement.
Smart girl.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
How much do you think you'll need?
Mrs. Doyle?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
You haven't even heard from him?
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Tired?
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
You mean "goodnight."
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
To get on home.
What about it?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
Too close.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Your name?
What?
Stay there.
Jim Stark.
Yeah.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
I think I should go home.
You still want to go home, Moose?
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
Hold it, Jim.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
Yes.
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
Sure.  Sure.
Have some cigars.
Look--just relax, will you?
Stay here.  That was my son!
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
I don't want to make friends.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
No.  In the morning.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
We know.
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
Man, you're schizoid!
Hey!  How 'bout that!
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
Who?
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Your father!
I'm fine.
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
My gun?
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Just tell a little white lie?
Grandma?
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
Chicken?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Who lives?
A what?
I'm not so bad.
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
Why?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Are you?
What?
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
What?
Gabriel, let him go --
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
YES!!!
We're talking, aren't we?
...whoever she is.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
One more. Smile. One more.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Yes it was all you --
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
NICK!
Nick --
You're in on this.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Canada.
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
You saved me.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
I'm almost done.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
They all are. Football's on.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
The hell I can't.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
Yes!
She says a lot of things.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
I said, who the hell made the map?
Put it on.
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
No, Gabriel... no...
What's the code?
I'm no threat without a gun.
'Tis the season, convict.
How'd you know my name.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
GO!!!
Mr. Bangs.
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Fuckin' freezing.
Five years. Since it opened.
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
How do we take them out?
How do we do that?
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
I promise you, I didn't know!
What?
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Thought you hate your old man.
What, working security?
Standing right here, man!
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
...for Christmas...
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Well...sorry...
But... I had a five...
They changed the layout.
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
You're coming back to work for us, right?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
Pam Grier.
How can you tell?
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
What for?
You can do some crazy things with it.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Down to my car.
Nice Guy Eddie.
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
I'm okay.
Joe.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
It's not good...
I can' take you to a hospital.
Lie back down, and try to -
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
That was the plan, we meet here.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
We can't take him to a hospital.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
I don't know anybody.
If we don't, he'll die.
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
And one of 'em is sick.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
His letters will keep.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Maybe it's better that way.
Hurry up.
Goodbye, Mary.
I haven't got the job yet.
Hello, Miss Wells.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
A man I used to know.
Like what?
Yes.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Swimming.
I won't again.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
I don't care what she asked you.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
All right, you didn't know.
I don't care.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
Yes, people make me restless.
There aren't any women here.
They went on like I told you.
Depends on how good you drive.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
What's the use.
That's it then.
I don't know -- I don't know.
What for?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
Oh, sure.
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
Thanks, Steve.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Never happened!
Okay.
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Hello Ray.
No, stay.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Alright!
It looks like the furnace.
Can you feel that?
No. Keep rubbing.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
But he'll kill her!
It's okay.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
I don't need your help.
Just wait, you'll see.
I'll go.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
I wouldn't go that far.
Saw who?!
Let me see the files.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
That one.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Are you sure it's not the tape?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
Yours, or the turkeys?
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
What?
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
Get out?! What does it say?
Is MOM... in there?
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
Jeeezzz!
MURDERED?!!
Why?
I don't feel like rewinding it!
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
This is so silly. 
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
We can be real quiet...
Ooohhhh!
What a mess.
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
I certainly was not!
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Yes, I was.
It's sugarless.
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
Yes... but... I didn't...
Right here!
He's a good boy.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
You forgot something...
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Thank you.
Yes.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
She can only use cash.
How much have you got?
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
"The Dante?"
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
I ought to know.
Nothing.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Why?
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
Yes.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Why wait?
You will die.
Yes.
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
I have something even better.
But you're always at the library.
I'm at sea, Jason.
Devil worshippers!
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
She was my patient.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
I should like people to read what I've written.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
Tell me what?
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
One believes -— it's like any other religion...
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
No, she's with her sister,
Why?
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
When?
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Who's Elizabeth?
Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Videotapes.
What kind of personal project?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I know.
What do you have to do to get ready?
It won't. Are you ready?
When we're making love?
Absolutely not.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
What was the problem?
How come?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
That's very flattering.
Why not?
Not entirely.
Possibly.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
You did that?
Who'd you have lunch with?
Are you having an affair?
Well, are you?
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
Yes!
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
What do you mean?
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Do you have to say that?
He doesn't have a phone.
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
But why did you want to?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
Did he touch you?
It looks like a tablecloth.
Well. I can't stay.
Okay.
Did you take your clothes off?
She still is.
Not exactly.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
So make an exception.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
Look, I'll call you, okay?
What's so stupid about it?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
I just... Ann is very...
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
You have family here also?
What do you mean?
I like having the car, the car is important.
Or go someplace in a hurry.
You know which tapes! Where are they?
Brian Kirkland, please.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Down to the incinerator.
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
BREAKING OUT
What's cookin', Bert?
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Dentonvale has been sold.
Who trusts experts?
Everything's free there.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
He was a President.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
He was adopted you know.
Of course.
Who?
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
It's...
You're practically naked!
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
YOUNG BLOOD
YOUNG BLOOD
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
What does he know about it?
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
WHAT A JOKE...
CRIMINAL
SIN-I-FUL
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
We love you, Baby.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
And?
Gary.
Bottle.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
No, I'm an actor.
I am one of those guys.
You said you had it all lined up.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Oh yeah. Much better.
I'm working on it.
Let me call Christine.
Huh.
So you're going to stop acting?
If that's what feels right.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Shut up.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Shut up. Shut your face.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
She's been leaving messages here too.
I will.  See ya!
Yep.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Nope.
You have to tell me --
Put me down, Jack.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
What's up?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Thanks.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
No way. No way.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
You said it looked like a car accident.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
The Windmill.
See you.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Yeah. Definitely.
Yeah. Thanks.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
What about me?
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
What rehearsal dinner?
But you wanted to fuck me first.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
So how're you doing?
I am.
I guess.
About four weeks.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
She doesn't answer me either.
My ballet recital.
Who said I was going to die?
Hi baby.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
Yes.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
I'm looking!
Me too.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Me too.
Edgar, come inside.
Don't do it.
Where are we going to sleep?
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
There are none.
What was the first thing?
Sounds like a virus.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
No.
Pinned? What does that mean?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
What book!
...And you had to kill him?
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
Sounds good.
Is he alive?
Right.
That's why I'm here.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
Yeah?
I've got a job.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
Believe it.
Why?
He'll be here.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I'm done talking. Get out.
That ain't right.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Who did it?
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
I just got to town.
It is that.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Give me some of the good stuff.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
Who?
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
Okay -- for you.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
I'll send you her resume.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
-- I can explain.
You're so good to protect her like this.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
I do?
Excuse me?  Start?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
When is she coming over?
Not quite.
I want you back too, Viktor.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
It was a great show, Dad...
Just a minute.
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Do what you do to Simone.
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
It was more in passing.
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
-- Please, get away from me.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
You saw that?
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
I'm already dead.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
Hello, sweetheart.
This week anyhow.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
Is she here tonight?
If anyone asks about Simone --
I noticed.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
-- I bet you have.
Abduction?
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Dark?
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
Long live the First Amendment.
Is that why she left you?
I don't understand.
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
Good.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Thanks.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
You use needles?
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
How do you draw now?
Look over there.
He your best buddy?
Words.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
I definitely won't.
Don't get mad.
Tell you my secrets.
Yeah.
Standing next to my window.
They want me to do things for them.
They used to hang people here.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
S-ssssstop it!
Chuck E. who?
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Nope.
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Not according to these.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
I didn't do anything --
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
-- "Billy-Jean" --
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
This is his room... isn't it?
"Blood?"
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Yeah?
Nah. Just you.
Mmmm -- so can I...
You never had trouble communicating before.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
No. Not without you --
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Never.
Spider.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Like what?
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Bill, we need to talk!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
No. What…?
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
Yeah. Good.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
I got to leave my post.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
What?
What can I do you for?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Hey, look!
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Your what?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
Last year, this was a new rig.
You paying for the gas?
What do you think?
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
You could've asked.
Like what?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
Yeah?
Bandit II?
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
That man is your father?!?
Absolutely.
See ya, Kate.
I'll do it.
You sure do.
Another time.
How'd you know?
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Redneck heaven.
Can a pig whistle?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
What does the old Timex say?
Yeah, guy?
I ran into complications.
We're gone.
Now what?
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
What's that, pardner?
Yeah, but...
Go head on, breaker.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
About one to five years worth.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And threw us into the lake.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
You woulda?
I'm not doing cocaine.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
Like a mafucka.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Security's locking down the elevators.
Leave the light off.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
How quickly?
He'll let me in.
I wish you'd told me.
What is it?
Why?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
Just get him to stop.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
I want you inside me right now.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
What do you mean?
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
It's something.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
You... she said I didn't love her.
No.  I love you.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Not this time.
Do you?
He is.  But he was here...
Then you'll die.
You should have told me.
Yes, you are --
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
I'm not Snow.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
I got money.
Yeah.
Sooner, the better.
Urdu and Hindi.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
But "nice".
You don't like him, do you?
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
They called here after you left...
Oh God, that's great!
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
"To"... Forget about you.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Nothing.
Sure we are, let's go!
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
I can still use a gun.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
It's not your taste.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
You heard me.
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I'm all right.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Is she injured?
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Lay back, Mack.
She's taking singing lessons.
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Be nice.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
You stop him?
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
I know.
Don't be pitiful.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Mr. Jameson--
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
How about tomorrow?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
I-- uh--
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
Does it have a human name?
I'd never admit that.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
I know him.
Any sign of our friend?
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
How is he?
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
No!
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Like it?
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Any news on Dunbar?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
In this barracks?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Why not?
You are talking crazy!
Twenty-five.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
My legs are frozen.
Sefton!
Not you.
Let's!
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
Abfuehren!
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Then droppen Sie dead!
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Stop it, Harry!
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
What's the award?
No?
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
She'll never forgive me!
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
Animal! Got a little something for you!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Anything else?
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
I called it the last time, didn't I?
You did!
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Thirty-fifth.
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Here. Take them.
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
A chicken?
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
You get what?
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Why would you want to leave?
It's our pleasure.
Better?
You could say that.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Where are the deflector relays?
What's normal?
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
Thank you.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Scotty...?
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
A photon tube...!
Logic indicates that is the case.
That may be difficult...
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
... A cloaking device?
About a dozen officers and men.
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.

All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.

Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
... Yes...
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Yes, my lord!
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
And who am I hiding from?
Ah.
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
I have my orders.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
Maybe...
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Never mind! Hurry!
What do you want with us? I demand --
I see. Helmsman?
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
What?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
Only half of you would get there.
The Admiral's son.
Let them eat static.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Aye, sir.
A few shots, sir.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Scotty, let's have it.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Best speed, Scotty...
Uhura, patch me in --
Spock...!
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Yes, sir.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
You earned it.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Take the test again.
Energize defense fields.
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
There is no such regulation.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
They just don't want us going in there.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Understood, sir.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Visual.
Trying, sir!
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Aft thrusters, sir.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Aye, sir.
I exaggerated.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
... They do, indeed.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
What do you mean?
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Cramps.
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Not me, Bones... They did it.
... My God...
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
How soon?
You've already been that. C'mon.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
Implicitly.
... You're very perceptive.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Right.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
What is our target in time?
Surely you can be more specific...
What are the variables...?
But you said toxic.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
... Aye sir...?
Aye, sir!
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Yes, sir.
Nothing... I should never have left him...
On screen.
Humpbacked - people.?
Two?
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
No power to the bay doors.
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Well, that's different.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
But not you.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
... an offlander?
Sometimes I do.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
No.
The artificial lifeform was right?
Are they in any danger?
Yes. But look at this medscan...
Is it safe to move her?
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
Scan for lifesigns.
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Recommendations?
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
Do you have everything you need from command?
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
Do you know how they were damaged?
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
Eject the core.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Deck ten.
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Ask them.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Sir?
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
Say the greeting again...
Good question.
What...?
Was I doing something to your neck?
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
All ship functions are off-line.
I look forward to reading your report.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
At least four hours.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I believe so.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Let's go.
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
I have the password right here.
There should be some kind of manual release...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
Ready.
You don't sound French.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
I can try.
'Fraid not.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
No. It's a lot further than that.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Target...
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
We DO sleep lying down.
That cunning little Vulcan...
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
You feign ignorance?
I checked the data banks, yes.
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Yes.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Now we go to Starfleet?
ALL uniforms?
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
Onscreen.
He's got it.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
There's a reward for your death.
Possibly.
Energize...
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Right -
Captain.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
They're dying.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
Make ourselves a target?
... is to trust him.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
Who else?
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
A lie?
An error.
I don't want to.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Visual!
What is it?
I think  not.
Nevertheless.
I believe I am.
Aye, aye, sir.
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
Yes, please continue.
You are me.
I am in a room with lights.
No. Can I move now?
For how long?
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
Dying?
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Sorry, sir.
Good work. The download?
Of you?
Divert power and compensate.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.

The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
How could I not?
I know how he thinks.
Do you have life support?
What do we know about the planet?
What do we know about the population?
Ready, sir!
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
Understood.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
What sort of signature?
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Yes.
Yes.
What's this all about?
Please.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
I am.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
Should I raise shields?
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.

I don't want to scare them away.
I don't see anything.
Thank you.
How much are your rooms?
It's still the full price.
We should have. Let me see.
It is beautiful.
Thank you.
Stay right there...
About five miles back.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
Oh shit!!!
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
You're not hearing me.
No, we don't.
Watch it. They're coming out.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
What.
That way.
Shit?
Candy.
A drink.
Shit!
You better.
A baby is a new person?
Why?
I do not speak English.
The car will stop?
Can I have the gun?
Yes.
Yes?
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
What is hell?
He will.
That was beautiful.
Yes. Sing some more.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
I can't stay on this planet.
You promised.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Nothing.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
I will say that we can be friends.
No, thank you.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
I will.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
What? No, of course not.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Get Fox.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Bullshit!
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Was there visual contact?
It could have been anything.
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
I wouldn't think so.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
You're going down.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Tell me.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
I'm on her.
But this is a bad one.
Why me?
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
I intend to.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Who was just here?
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
She never gave me a tape.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
Sure.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Jesus, Mace!
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
Yeah.  We did.
Are you going to make me beg?
You really want that on your head?
Um... he was older.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
You're thinking...?
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
She's buried.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
This is Agent Mackelway.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Not as much as you'd think.
Hi. What's in the case?
You must travel a lot, huh?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
What's with the eyelids?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
What?
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
What I do requires confidentiality.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I don't believe this.
I was visiting an old college friend.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Not especially.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
They're all criminals?
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
That's true.
What's that?
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
No weapon.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
It was the mall.
Those were just fantasies.
You? You went by the book?
Yeah.
Lead the way, Murman.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[You tell me.]
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Yes, sir.
The same.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
350 miles.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
You're right. I know.
Shuddup.
You're money, baby.
You better pay the man.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Tell me about it...
Yeah.
What what? What advantages?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
...and even then...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Oh... right.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Why not?
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
Yeah?
Why didn't you call?
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
Bud.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
I just tested for one...
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
No. Just O.J.
She wasn't your type anyway.
Well, you're doing so well...
I didn't make it...
Sure.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
...People get carjacked...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
I don't know...
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
What Vegas?
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Vegas!
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
What?!?
I know, but...
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Yea, how much?
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
Hold on.
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
How?
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
Aww... He got away?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
What a surprise.
No, baby!
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
...Is he brown?
...double diamond...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
...it's definitely on.
You don't have to wait three days...
...just be smart about it.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
Ba Fa Goulle.
Like hell I will.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
And with prison record.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
For killing a man.
I'll need him.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
You look good, too.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
We're all tired...
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Mama, no.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Yes.  Tell me.
Al Capone!
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Sure.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
How is your father?
Please say it.
OK. 
I'm busy.
Let me think about it, O.K.?
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
What?
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
He talked to you?
Well, we ate everything without you.
I don't get it.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
That's funny.
What? What's this?
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I love jazz.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
This is so good of you.
I played piano in a few places.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Copy out from here...
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
What club?
I thought you'd missed the train.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
Really? To Italy?
Marge and I are getting married.
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I'm fine.
Where's Dickie?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
Dickie did it.
Get on. I'll take you to him.
Hello Marge!
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I don't believe you.
No glasses.
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
I hope so.
I think we sort of found each other.
Excuse me?
What?
How did you know that?
I know.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
It's okay.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
Peter, I... I...
Of course. What happened to your face?
Who mam?
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
I can believe that.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
I bought a couple of tickets.
What's wrong?
I'm leaving.
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
Keep it.
Hello, Betsy.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
With who?
Have you been noticing anything strange?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
Is he Italian?
You sure he's not Italian?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
No.
And what happened?
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
In the jungle. 122nd.
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
Iris.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I musta been stoned.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Huh?
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Do I look like a narc?
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
I know. I tried that.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Oh?
You would, huh?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
Shit.
What's going on?
Things got ya down?
It happens.
The taxi life, you mean.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
I'm not a fool, Billy.
What's that?  Mason?
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Delly?  In here.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
Well...
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
And why not?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Nothing.  
I'm  fine.  Really.  
Oh.
I don't smoke?
Oh.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
By all means.
When did I leave?
Can't wait.
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Vultures...
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Thanks.
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
So, it is a blacklist.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
What do you mean?
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Well, that's not what they think.
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
I taught you that.
Yeah... me too.
Thanks.
What exactly did you hear?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
Yes.  Very.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
I think so.
I despise it.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
Different?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Because she was afraid.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
She already has a daughter.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Take them.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Morning.
Yep.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmm.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
It's nothing.
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
I don't know.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
Oh, my God, look at her!
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
Do I sound foolish to you?
I don't mind, really.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Yes.
Monday?
Well, I...
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
Lovebirds.
Aren't these lovebirds?
The sign says strawberry finches.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Ahhh, but I know you.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
What for?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Look, Mr. Brenner...
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
You are, aren't you?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Seven o'clock then.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Oh. That. Rome.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Yes, but...
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Why?
Cheers.
Growing a beard...
It was like that yesterday.
The bay doesn't.
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Inland.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
You said three o'clock.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Not if they're starting a war.
Of course.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
I've heard of it.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
Well? And are you not a good student?
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
I can't believe that.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
No.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
Not yet.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
I can't.
Don't call me that confounded name.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
The heart pumps it.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
I know --
Only Brother.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
Aye --
He must leave me alone.
You sent them. I had no choice.
The scar.
Nobody.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
I don't want to see!
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
It's what Lauren would do.
I don't know. I found him lying there.
I know.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
You mean Alex.
What did I say?
Just hold on to me.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
Looks like you have them both on.
About you.
I don't believe you.
Yes -- that is true.
Would you care to be more specific?
That's what I came to see you about.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
What do you mean, dear?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Where is that?
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Mr. Brady's a cop.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
I feel different right now.
I'm not going to marry anybody.
Naturally I think so.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
May I walk out with you?
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
Would you like to sell it?
That's right.
No -- I'm afraid not.
They would have killed this man?
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
You gotta drive!
You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
What?...
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
For a ride.
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
I can't do that!
Hit the lights again.
Chill out Edgar.
What?
Okay, okay.
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
Did we have a date tonight?
This is Michael.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Gotta go, Mom.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
In here?
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Do I look that needy?
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Okay.
No... no, everything's different now...
Okay.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Because I love you...
I was here first.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Don't turn on the light.
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
What about Mom?
The Marines.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Maybe.
So what's our problem?
Anybody sick?
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Watch Clark.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Don't walk behind me.
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
If it did get to him.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
Cut him loose?
Probably the next meal.
We ain't buying that.
Thank you.
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
No.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
Why?
Anyplace but here.
MacReady, that you?
MacReady...?
When do you think it got to him?
What?!
The journey is part of my work.
What else can they do?
But you're only a mud carrier.
How did you know?!
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
What?
It was meant to.
Yes.
This is the way in?
I'll never forget this.
As slaves.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
A man can change his history.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
I just love mechanical things.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
I mean... well... affection.
No... let's walk through the city.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
Good night, Alex.
Thank you.
More than 800,000 years.
Why not?
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
I can see Kalen's point.
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
What are you?
It must have been safe.
Orion's belt...
You lost someone.
Mara...?
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
May I get you some --
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
Why?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
They've gone to a better place.
We choose to believe it.
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
And you've no idea where he went?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
That's too bad.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
My business?
You sure you know where to find one?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
No, we were patients.
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
How?
Yeah.
Yes.
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
Ok.
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
I could try to...make it stop.
Believe me, I know.
Why?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
How...how do you know?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Don't you go to jail for that?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
You don't have anywhere to stay?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No, I'm ok.
I'm sorry.
What?!
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
A .38.
My Lord.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
Shut up.
Thelma?  It's me.
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
What the fuck is going on?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Oh yeah.
Yes.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
Okay.  I will, too.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Isn't this fun?
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Get the car!
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Why are you actin' like this?
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
I don't know.  I won't be.
It's probably not a good idea.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
I won't wait up.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Yeah.
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
I believe you.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Good.
We can change our names.
It'd have to be pretty good.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
All this for us?
What?
No, I just meant...
You sent that?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Yeah, but he was successful.
Loser? You?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
I am?
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
No.
Jesus Christ you're right.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
You got a brew?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
No thanks.
Some buildings I'm working on.
What's that?
-- He's in a cage?!
Great.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
That...? Vestibule.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
You're a movie buff?
Have you seen it?
A fucking moron.
-- Love story of our time.
Huh... that's strange.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Forget it. It was... fun.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Do what?
What?
Who?
Fucking sickening.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
That must make it tough.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
Healy.
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
Thanks a lot, Ted.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Really? I never got a message.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
All right, let's go.
You forgot your keys!
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
I wish.
You got what stuck?
Shhhhhh!
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Giddy-up.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
What are you doing?
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
Smoke.
Yes it is.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Still heading for Cuba.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Forget it, Scotty.
He was.
Dean Rusk!
I, uh...
No you weren't.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
I don't know. I don't know.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
Sioux Indian, right?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
What journey?
Good. Thank you.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Jesus...
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
How'd you know?
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
When did we get that?
She's that subtle?
Yes.
You've got no jurisdiction.
His spiritual mother...
He knows me?
She's your sister?
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Ray --
What you call myths, we call our history.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Cuz you're a cop.
What are you talking about?
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
So they took care of Leo.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
You didn't have another vision...
That's right. Turn around.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
Mister Tully.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
Well, it is. It is that, too.
I could be, too.
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Where were you?
I was inverted.
Apology acknowledged.
Too aggressive?
I'm special.
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.

I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
And now?
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
Where'd you get it.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
What do you want?
What?
Hardly ever.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
True.
Take something off.
Your watch.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
Okay, okay.
BREAKING LEFT!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Got you here.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
What?
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
I want him!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Let's go. Eject.
Was.
That's because you don't have any women.
We did it.
Just below ten thousand.
Three guesses.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Didn't everybody?
How's it goin', Coog?
I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
Is that how you remember it?
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
He was by the book, all the way.
It's not true.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Over there man.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
Why not?
The Last Resort!  Quick!
How'd you find me?
May I use your pen?
So why am I still alive?
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
I am Quaid.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Swallow this.
Where?
Arrest that woman!
You tell me.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
Oh, Rekall.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
Let me buy you a drink.
I've got Quaid.
What is it?
Come on!
How did I get in this taxi?!
Mmmm.....
I don't know.
I'm late.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Doug...
I'm not your wife.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
I'm here at Rekall.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
I used to model for 'em, why?
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
I saw them.
Oh, since when?
It's just up ahead.
I gave you?
What?
No problem.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Burt, can you hear me now?
In a minute.
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Could we make it to the mountains?
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
You got that right.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
The rifle.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Me, too.
Right.
We got a plan!
Like hell you are.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Not yet, not yet...
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
God, what a stink!
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
You okay?
Yeah.  One, two, three...
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
An hour after you picked it up!
Please... I need to sleep...
I know about Esparza.
True.
Let go of my hair.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
No further questions.
We had a description of the suspect.
Not at all --
Right. You're right.
-- The Nazi he knifed?
-- Remember?
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
-- Yeah?
Roger Baron.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
...For ten years, now.
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
You're doing a murder case?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
Screw you too, Kitty.
Exactly what happened then?
About Chinatown. What went down.
You tell me, man.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
"No," what?
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Calls for speculation.
No? Then what did he say?
-- Eddie told you?
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
And you b-believe that.
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Albert.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
I want you.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Bobby...
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
Smell something fishy, huh?
Teresa Banks.
No, sir, we did not.
What happened to her?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
What do you mean?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
She must have known someone.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
I don't know what to do.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
Maybe.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
No, you're the muffin.
Nothing.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Not you, Donna, not you.
No.
I can't help you there.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
I haven't got it yet.
Maybe.
What does Bob say?
No... No...
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I'm not.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
James...
I can't tonight.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
...school's fine...
Not really.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Yes.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
Nothing, I chickened out.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
There's no one here.
Very good.
As far as we know, nothing.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Yes.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
And no one will know the truth.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
Nothing further, your Honor.
Tell me one?
...We did everything we could...
...that's all right.
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No, you did fine.
Well...
The Doctors were not negligent.
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Yes.
Yes? Galvin, right?
Her doctors killed her.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
I understand.
Hi. How are you doing?
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Ready, your Honor.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Overruled...
Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
Still looking.
And what are you? A cop?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Maybe what?
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
You, you don't under...
It's over!
No.
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
No.
Nothing happened.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
It's locked.
...I know. I went...
Yes. Yes, I have.
...fifty thousand dollars?
...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
What?
Admittance form is wrong.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
You use their witness.
Read me what she said.
We got to talk.
She did?
We, we were rather busy...
Huh. And why is that?
Yes.
We'd be in all the papers!
All right - I've seen enough!
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
How can you say that when you don't know him!
I didn't know how to stop you...!
It's gone now.
Don't you live at home?
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
It was...  ...one of them!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
So is the town, I notice!
It's always been a good persuader.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
D.O. to number three..come in.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
Chase...
No biggie, really.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
Chase. Hi...
What?  What kind of episode?
Like what?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
No.
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
Oh my God...
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
Everything is not fine!
They were safe and could sleep.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
Right 'cross the freeway.
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Coming for you...
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
Yeah, sure.
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
They wouldn't let me...
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Coffee'd be nice.
Not yet.
Yep.
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
I didn't know sir.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Okay.
Whatever.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
To take a piss.
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
That's not why he's sending me.
Because it looks good.
Shut up, Phil.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
Do what?
Yes sir.
Unfurl the squares!
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
He killed the dolphin.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
He's a big boy.
And, of course, we are.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
I should be eating with the crew.
You do?
Yes sir.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
They'll know about it in the morning.
Why would you do that?
I couldn't do it.
About anything.
Long enough.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
I'm not staying out here.
I can't.
Aaauuuhhh!!!
Yes, I was.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
Yessir.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Well... Yeah - okay.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Fuck me.
You was in the Marines, huh?
You an indian?
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
She really say she was pregnant?
Thanks.
Set one up.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
...Asshole.
I'm sorry.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
You ain't actin', mama.
And?
Why, honey?
Peanut...
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
No, he picked me up.
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
What's that?
So?
What'd you say to her?
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
What kinda trash talk is that?
Come look at this.
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
We'll find out in a hurry.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Under a hundred.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
If you say so.
What's that?
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
No radio or TV...
You sick?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
You talk to 'im some?...
Went with Bobby.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
What could I be up to, Lula?
What?
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
I'll bet.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
Santos... It isn't.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Yes.
Yes.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
No.
Whattya mean?
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
I didn't see nothin'...
She's still a transvestite.
Isn't she?
I thought you were tinkering.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
He heard everything we were saying.
Just go around him.
His parents.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
Only in your bones?
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
No wonder he screwed us over.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
You did.
And your wife left you.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
...You carry firearms.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
Sounds like a good one.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
It's colder in there.
That's really it.
Really?
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
You?
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
Sure.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Hm.
Yeah, well, actually...
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Amazing.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
That's right. That one.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
I didn't mean it that way.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
In a minute. Get us a table.
When nobody's looking.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Yes, James.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
Oh. Well. I...
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
It beats 'What's your major?'
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
You got me.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
James Leer.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
Grady.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Hey, Professor Tripp.
As a heart attack.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
Just kidding.
You want to keep him happy.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
No shit.
How is she?
This little table is one heavy bitch.
Huh?
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
Isn't it?
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
Birds.
Sure.
The mother sure has her hands full.
Their sound is quite musical.
It's hard to describe.
It's a bright sound.
That was terrific.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
It's my bird book.
I have friends.
Robin.
Cop.
No.
Woodsman?
Little Red Riding Hood.
What?
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I count my blessings.
You are in.
Why's that?
No you're not.
Yes?
I know because... it's just something I know.
A diary?
Honest? No.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
We have a lot of work to do.
I couldn't say.
What is your idea of being normal?
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What did you think would happen?
I want you to calm down.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
I don't know.
Why?
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
I see my sister.
Not so fast.
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
All right.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
This is garbage!
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
Yes.
I was six years old!
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
I'm all right.
Me?
Neither do you.
I like the noise.
What about them?
Maybe later.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
The worst?
How many girls did you molest?
What did you do to them?
Twelve years in prison?
You don't really --
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
Sounds like a special guy.
I know.
What?
I think it's a fucking good idea.
What's it look like?
You're such an asshole.
Nothing.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Your rig?
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
What do you think he saw?
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Chill out, Lindsey!!
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
I don't know, look around.
How?
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
No.
God, I hate that bitch.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Yuh?
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
You watch yourself.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Turn it up, bozo.
Give me that!!
How many are there?
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
He's hallucinating badly.
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
I'm thirsty.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
Maybe you'd better ask him.
That seems to apply to you also...
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
But then when will we see each other?
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
Who knows why they all left...
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
So, you wonder why?
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
But why all nudes?
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
What do you think?
We'll try again.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
No, not like this one.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Unfortunately, no.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Lady Patrizia!
You know, I don't love anybody.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
Is that possible?
You really must do me this one favor.
He talked to you Himself?
Why?
Who told you this?
That's not what he meant.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Oh my dear child.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Dear Jesus...
Yes Mother.
I burnt them.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
What would you like to talk about.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Everyone.
Yes.
Oh, I know he does.
Oh, yes.
In the confessional.
And what happened?
And then what?
Then let's talk about something else...
Anything.
I don't know.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
She'd get angry.
I could never be a mother.
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
Not my fault.
I breathed!
Yes.
... makes me...
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
I'm afraid.
No I'm not.
Doctor Livingston.
To help me.
Because I was afraid.
It grew.
I can't tell you that.
I ate.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
No... don't hit me please...
Yes.
Who?
Where?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
Yes.
I put her to sleep.
Sister...
Why?
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Thanks...
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Uh huh.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
Who told you this?
What business is it of yours..?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
... Thank you.
No-one.
I am not with the Inquisition.
What's your opinion?
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
That's ridiculous...
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
What?
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
Then help her.
There's another choice.
Answers.
Earthquakes?
What is it?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Oh, dear God.
Don't deny it!
No, it reminds me.
Long, thin and filtered.
Of course.
Who is he?
You're saying God did it?
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
I'm concerned about her health.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
No!
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Then she's a liar.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Yeah?
What they like?
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
You do - repeatedly.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
I'll have a bash.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
No, straight up.
Ah well. Eh, look!
Wake up!
We do.
Is he?
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
Come here.
Well, what happened?
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
See you.
Out where?
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
Yeah ... that's right.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Have they?
Lip reading.
Don't dramatise.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
He's got you worried, then?
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Like what?
Please, can I have one to surge with?
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Hello.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
I knew I could rely on you.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Oh, leave off!!!
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Hell, we're equipped --
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
Dell, plot our location.
Yeah.  Two hours.
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
You want to try?
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Hard to say.
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Still unconscious?
Good.
Oh my God.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
We're not going anywhere.
Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
I think it's fizzled out.
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
My signal's fading.
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Look --
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Anything else?
Found what?
What killed it?
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Food-storage room!
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Here, carry these.
What did it do to you?
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Thanks.
Okay, give me the numbers.
What's happening?
We're not gonna make it, are we?
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Shit.  When?
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
Yeah?
What?
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
What's wrong?
Yeah, I...
It's alright, it's cool...
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
You've checked that end?
How many... how many people are missing?
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
And before that?
Only six?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Check out the tent.
Hold on...
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
What can I do?
No!
Phoebe.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
Please do.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
That's right.
Yes. The Shubert.
I believe I will.
It wasn't meant to be.
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
What else?
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
A dull cliche.
What of it?
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
Yes, Addison.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
You're being childish.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
Amen.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Frankly, I don't remember.
Huh?
Where?
That's nice.
Maybe just a little around the edges.
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
Thank you so much.
I'm a junk yard.
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
Call me when you get in...
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Sing it?
I get a party, don't I?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
What?
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
That never stopped you before.
She's a girl of so many interests.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
Gone.
Don't mix your metaphors.
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
I've been aware of that for some time.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
Glory Hallelujah.
Groom.
You know what I'm going to be?
A married lady.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Is it the money?
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Of course not.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
But she just got here...
Of course!
Oh, brother.
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
See you home...
Behind in your dues? How much?
Oh-oh.
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Karen.
The show must go on.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Over my dead body...
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Of course it is.
San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Hello, Miss Channing.
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
The heave-ho.
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
It doesn't matter.
Well... all right.
Check.
You'll be there, won't you.
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
Where'd you get all that information?
That was a pity...
I'm beginning to catch up.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Nothing...
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
... Among so many quiet qualities.
What is he talking about?
The play? All right, I guess...
How do you mean?
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
What do you mean?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Would you?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Well...
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
I promise.
Answer my question!
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--a spy, you mean?
We need a sympathetic face.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
--we will--
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Maybe we are...
Only everything...
--yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
That's right.
You can't.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
--yes--
And?--
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
--what?--
--there's nothing new in it--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
...No... never in so many words...
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
What do you want to know?
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
I'm not your source on that.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
How senior?
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
--I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- 
Look, I told you inside--
You're a lawyer and you're here--
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Mitchell knew then.
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Howard Hunt here.
James McCord.
The C.I.A.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
It is.
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
Could develop.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
Absolutely.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
When so ordered.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
A girl. Melissa.
Of course--everything they asked--
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Thanks coach.
Like what?
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Of course, I didn't --
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
You talked to Stifler?
What?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Sure.
What?
But that one time --
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
You can crash at Stifler's?
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Pontificated.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
She's already on a plane back home.
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Don't you want me to?
No -- Kevin, you?
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
I thought so.
Me?
Oh no.
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
You think so?
Kevin, this is serious!
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah, are you?
Me too.
Yeah, right here.
I want to hear you say it.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
He didn't?
I think we're falling in love.
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Doing what?
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
Just like sex with my wife.
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
But you better hurry.
No it isn't! You're dead!
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Andy!
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
It's okay. I can see fine.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I know. He told me.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Yeah. French fries...
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
What...?
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Who's Sophie?
Come out! I can do alterations.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Who are you?!
Trying... to... breathe...
No!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
Don't be
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
I'll never let go!
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
Is it? Is this what you want?
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
What do you mean?
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Remove him at once.
Promise me she'll have her home.
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Who are you?
Yes.
Alvy.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Tsch.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Well, stop listening to him.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
M'hm...
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
think that's, uh-
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
M'hm.
Yeah.
U-huh.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I dunno.
You don't want me to live with you?
It relaxes me.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Yeah?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Yeah.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
snow shovel or anything or something.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
It's for my complexion.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Oh! My God! 
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Oh-
Thanks, honey.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I can't.
My head is throbbing.
I have a headache.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Hey.
Whatta you mean?
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
We're gonna operate together.
SO?
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Hey-
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
I was a great beauty.
Why last?
She's got great tits.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
What?
It's alright, isn't it?
I'm in mourning.
Not this time.
He's allergic.
Borrow whatever you like.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Yeah.
He's not going tonight.
And you're not the wife.
Count on it.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Harry called.
Leave us alone right now.
We live next door.
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Anytime, sport.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
There's still time to undo this.
Just do what I say, alright?
Beats a lawsuit.
Ryan's novel.
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
For good.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Panes is not on your team anymore.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Well he can't have gone far.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
I'll never forgive you.
Everybody hates the messenger.
I'll be with you.
I guess.
It's a Calder.
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
And you know, he really does not.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Lemon.
I think he's really angry with me too.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
You're not serious.
Yes.
How long ago was it?
No, never.
Yes.
Oh?
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
What does that mean?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
I don't want to talk about it.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
What are they?
And here they are!
Ah.
I hope they're watercolors!
Oh Soph...
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
And Cal's this massive adult?
You weren't exactly horrified.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
You -- you think I'm right?
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Yes?
Oh no...
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
You did?
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Ant Team Six...
Oh, no, sir!
That's correct, sir!
No, sir!
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
I can't think of any.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
What do I do?
Yeah.  How much?
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
Sheldrake?
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
That's me. 
I should have stayed in bed last night.
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
How is your cold?
So I see.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
How many of those drinks did you have?
This is a bad day for me.
The mirror -- it's broken.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
You don't have to entertain me.
Give what up?
A bad insurance risk?
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
Oh.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
You did?
No, I don't.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Yes, sir.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
Sir?
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Mine?
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
So what's it going to be?
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Oh, I'm very grateful.
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Something like that.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Just as long as she's okay.
Well, I have things to do --
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
No.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
We talked about a lot of things.
I wasn't trying.
Are you sure that's what you want?
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
All set for what?
Atlantic City?
The nerve.
Sssssh.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Lovely. You were a big help.
See if they'll what?
I said I like all of them.
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
Esprit de corps --
One for all -- all for one --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
Sort of.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Tracks ?
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
We do.
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
That we're dumber than we look.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
Yeah, it is.
Not a thing.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
What is it?
Looks pretty shallow.
Anyone got a cigarette.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Charlie?
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Thank you, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
Boss left.
Six to eight feet.
When did you hear?
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
Who?
It'll get here, soldier.
What do you mean, Colonel?
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
How's the pain?
Just something I read in the Free Press.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
Why didn't he shoot you?
What things?
Yes.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
I do.
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --

There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
Keep back.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
She's dead.
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
-- Corbett's a killer.
The radio's on the fritz.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Why?
I bet you haven't had lunch.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
It's exactly what you meant.
-- Permanently?
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
New to the country, kid?
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
You don't feel cold?
You got one?
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
No, I better stay at my post.
But I would.
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
What does this matter to you?
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
It's a long shot.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
We were just talking about him.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I want us to go out.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Don't be silly. How bad?
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Yes.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
I've got Jews at my table.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
How old are you?
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
What's with the dark?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
How do you know about my mother?
No!!! Stay away from me!
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
You take off when you have to.
Is there another way to see it?
Are you still coming?
No.
Can we order first?
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
It was a mistake.
This one has a special meaning.
Yeah... Well...
I can trust my brain.
Go ahead.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Were you asleep?
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
All right, cut me a break.
I'll take care of myself --
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
He's a pain in the ass.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
About a dog.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
How're you doing?
'Love was... '
Do you realize that I work at him?
Okay, then.
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
You consider your life easy.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
I'm coming.
I forgot to lock the door.
Just a second -- he has to go.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
So you're from around here?
What is this?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
You're right.  Talking too much again.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
What?  What's okay?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
$1,000,000.
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Ten million --
Until a minute ago.
Another contractor.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
It's not the same, is it?
But you knew what they were training you for?
Ahhhh...
Why not?
Tell me about the first time.
Yes.
Because I want to know.
That's fiction.
Why not?
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Yes.
Taiwan.
Thank you.
We split the money?
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I didn't notice them.
Jesus, if someone had --
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Thank you.
Why?
Did he explain how this happened?
Why?
No.
I'm not normal.
Oh, God.  I see it!
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
All the time.
I hope not.
Taken.
American currency.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
He was an electrician?
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
When your ready Son!
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
What?
No, the boyfriend.
She's cool.
What are you on about?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
Tell me some bad news?
That bad?
What happened?
So?
Here!
I'm not hungry, really.
What are you talking about?
No!
That one?
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
Yes.
No!
Regards to Her Majesty.
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Ooh, well excuse me.
You used to read.
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
Don't worry it's okay!
No way Doug, I can't.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
There's nothing there for me.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
It's not so much.
Yep, it's all yours.
Great....How long will it go for?
Good, great....Dobchay!
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
What for?
What is bail?
Am I invited?
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Guests.
Cool!
It's Josh's.
Fuck you!
It was the biggest I could find.
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
Working....Under cover.
Yeah.
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
But I have to finish this....
Later.
Go to hell!
You bastard!
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
We're not sure...
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
Very well.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
That's over. Way over.
You're fine like that, Mom.
Thanks.
Yeah.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
I didn't know either.
He wants to talk to you.
I need to whizz.
I'm just wondering --
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Know so.
The world of the dead?
The dirty snowball at its core.
In ten words or less?
Belinda's a very jealous person.
Thank you. So were you.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
That sounds like horseshit.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
It means you can do anything.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
What?
I wanted this to be a date.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
I was twelve.
Mars.
Pull over.
I should have told you sooner --
That I want you to take me home.
That's what I mean.
Tired.
That was read at my parents' wedding.
Better. I was really angry.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
He wants help with his lines --
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Up to?
It was a play.
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
Lead man.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
Ever again.
Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
How -- how long does she have?
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
Please.
I'd work backstage or something?
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
A similar triangle?
Scalene?
I beg your pardon?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Uh, thanks...
Uh, hi....
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Home, school, here... 
Pro! Release the rope!
Is Shemp all right?
That's just great!
You were ringing the doorbell!
Professor, be serious, would you?
Well, it was there.
You did what?!?
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
I run this place! 
Okay.
Yeah.
They're okay.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Sure thing. Come on.
Sure.
Tom...
Thanks.
What'd you come out here for?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
Yeah? Why not?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
Holly.
There you go.
Great.
Spanish.
I know.
It's your play.
What?
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
You said that once already... Too late now.
Excuse me.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
It was going too fast.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
How about over here?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Yeah.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Wanta sue me?
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Vanished. Thin air.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
It?  Who does?
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Believe in Penny Priddy?
It's too dangerous.
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
A what?
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres – please call me Barton.
...I know this must look... funny.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Hello.
...Who is this?
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
Bill –
Stop it, Bill!
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
...Who?
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
What DID you mean?
What else?
Are you all right?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Well, you just... sound a little–
That's all right, really, thank you.
Okay... a quick one, sure...
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
Charlie. How are you.
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
We gotta call the police –
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Must be.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
He's a little funny in the head.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
...Fred...
How's about it, Bart?
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
Thanks.
It's been three months.
No.
Sometimes I really hate you.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
What?
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
I have nothing to hide.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
You know all about me.
No.  Come in.
No, thanks.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
There's a name from the past.
Do you?
What if I call you Nicky?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
What's it about?
I'll risk it.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Fine.  How's your back?
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I don't have a choice.
I know.
No?
I don't know.
I found Lisa Henderson.
It won't sell.
Somebody always does.
How did it end?
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
No.
He was murdered.
Why would I need an attorney?
Cocaine.
Nilsen?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
What are you doing here, Pop?
I got tired of being played with.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
I went over last night, too.
I feel fine!
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
I don't believe it.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
Yeah.  I know.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
We bring her in for questioning.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
No. Should I have?
Rene's been telling me about your work.
Not sure. How was yours?
Do you ever get sick of it?
The whole thing – painting.
It's in New Jersey.
I think it's in New Jersey.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
How about right now?
I can get ten.
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
I need a dealer.
Yes, but as a black painter –
Out?
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
What's wrong with you today?
About what?
Hi Gina.
Come on in!
For real?
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
It's Monday morning.
Basquiat, what did you take?
Staten Island would be ok.
Think so?
You mean babies with you?
You're your own baby.
A present I picked up for you.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
George?
I don't believe it, Jean – they're picking straws.
What's his name?
Me? Why?
Wanna Mac?
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
What time is it?
I just don't think you're being fair.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
I'm -- sorry, I --
We do.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
"We"?  You and...
Nope, I told her everything.
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
Dad!  Save yourself!
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
What is it?
Thanks.
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
What seems to be the problem?
Pheromones?
I recognized the accent.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Keep it.
Alfred's happy here.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
I'm afraid to ask.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
I didn't kill your wife.
I can make it.
Can he save her?
She knows who we are.
People come first, Dr. Isley.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I wish I knew.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
But he's never said a word-
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
I knew you could handle it.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
I've got to stop him.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
He ran away?
The _Rolls_?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Big house. How many rooms?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
What?
What?
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Yesssssss. I know!
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
Paranoid? The psychotic?
What the hell is going on here?
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Here. Get a good seat.
Miss.
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
WHICH CAR?
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
... Looks like a convention.
I wish you'd...
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
... Where are you calling from?
What now?
Take 'em! I want his head!
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
What are you talking about?
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
It's gone.
Yeah. Deja vu.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
I said I'd check with you.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
Did you really ask?
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
No, I'm fine.
Thanks, Annie.
Uh ... yes ...
Ahm.... .
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
Certainly is.
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
Sean Connery.
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
What's your problem Beavis?
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Me first! Me first!
Me first!
Cut it out butt-hole!
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Cool! Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
What's your problem Beavis?
Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Butt-snatch...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Cut the power!
D.C., Chief.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Yup. Huh huh.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
What's she doing here?
Won't?  Or can't?
That's my girl!
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
That's all we need.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
Little black party dresses?
Is this like a trick question?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
Really.  I don't know.
We're...
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
No, wait!
Step... mother.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
They're dead.
I want to get in.
Yeah.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Good girrrl!
You've got to help them.
... I will.
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Why not?
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
Let me have it.
Stepmother.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
I cannot believe this.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
Otho, can you do it?
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
Any particular kind?
It wasn't a joke.
I thought I saw something.
Viridian?
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
Look at the tiny figures.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Yes. I think so, too.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Thank you.
Yes.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
No. I like this attic very much.
Yes. Thank you.
Oh? Certainly...
Hello, Eve.
That's good.
Good night, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
... Mentor...?
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Hello, Eve.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Yes. That could be true.
Thank you, Eve.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
Hello, Sid.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Hello, Morton.
I see.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Yes, I understand.
Oh, good.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes. You look very sick.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Yes. That is correct.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
I like to watch.
Hello, Ronald.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes.
Oh. Thank you.
No.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Good day, Sally.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
... Good evening, Louise.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
I'm going to work in the garden.
Yes.
Yes. That is surprising.
I hope so.
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
I was given meals, and a home...
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
... Oh, really...
Yes, I will.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Try again.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Hello, Sophie.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
Look, Johanna...
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
No problem, Chief.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
That could be possible...
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Hmmm.
She's very beautiful.
Hi.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
What?
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
No they're not.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I'm sorry for everything.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Simulates?
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
Schwartz.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
No, really.
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Sure. It'd be fun.
My God.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
You're evil, Maxine.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fork ah did?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Think, Jew florist?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
Did you see the reviews?
No.
Do you mind?
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh, Lotte...
What the fuck is going on?
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Whatever.
Then what do I do?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Baby, don't be like that.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
Yes ma'am.
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Morning, ma'am.
You sure?
He's sleeping in the church.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
I don't know him that well.
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
That's so.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
I don't want to know.
Yeah. Look bad?
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
She left me. She's gone again.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
Yeah, it sucks.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Far out.
Color?
And was there anything of value in the car?
And the, uh, the briefcase?
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
Take a look at this, sir.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Now I got--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Delayed after-eff--
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Mmnun.
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
What?
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
What the fuck are you--
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
No, you're not wrong--
Yeah.
What if it's during a game?
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
Whose toe was it, Walter?
The nail polish, Walter.
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Dude--
Huh?
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Uh-huh.
Come on, Walter!.
Wha.
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Dude, I'm sorry--
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Who is this?
...Us? DUDE
Yeah?
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
Right, Dude.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
I don't know, sir.
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Well. . . yeah.
I said out.  Now.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
He's half yours, partner.
Nothing.
Minutes.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
So?
Thought you were dead.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Human?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
You experimented on your own, son?
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Not that I'm in contact with.
Us?  What are you talking about?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Are we bringing home strays now?
Just do it, old man.
Don't even start, old man.
Watch me.
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
There is no cure.
He will.
Some kind of archive --
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
I was afraid that might happen.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
You.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
Get away from him!
You've been listening in the whole time?
Go on, I'll be fine!
How?
Bullshit! Talk!
Mrs. Leavitt--
The Witch's voice.
--Nick!!
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
Yes.
We've looked at half of one tape.
Get your goddamn--
No.
I can't.
No.
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
--fuckin' A right--
--which'd be about ten bucks--
Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
I do.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
--Cotter: shut up.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
Down there in the Park.
For "James?"
No one ever comes here.
--Graduate Thesis--
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
--now there.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
All I need--
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Ancient runes--
Ah, Domini?
No. I don't think so.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
Then I have no idea.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
Okay.
Still working on it.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
It touched me, don't you see it now?
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
--a <u>lot</u>.
Shoot.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
I don't....
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
What happened to my Dad??
I am?
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Meurice--
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
You wouldn't be putting me out.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
...Huh?
...Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
...What do you mean?
...What was that?
In the trunk.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
About ten years.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
What?
Lubbock?
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
What do you mean...
How long did you watch her?
No. It just made them feel better.
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
Ya catch any fish?
How would I know?
Right.
What.
Meurice...
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Tuesday.
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I've seen a few.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
You did? A human ear?
It's blue. blue velvet.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
No. not at all.
Yes sir.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
. mommy's here.
Then, shut up!
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Yeah.
I wanted to see you.
You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Then you got undressed.
Never before this.
No. Come on.
No.
No. What is happening?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Don't say that.
O.K.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
. same here.
Who's it, you mean.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
Whatiya mean?
Yes.
Kiss me.
Do you love me?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Yes.
Maybe so.
Yeah. Good bye.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Alright.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
No way. I'm about to blow up.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
You want to go talk to him?
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
No.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Let's wait for some slow one.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
uh uh.
Be right down.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
No. No thank you.
Yeah.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
What?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
You'll see for yourself.
Derek!
Baby, you didn't have to come.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
You're a fucking amateur!
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Get me a six pack.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Murder.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Because they caught me?
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
Okay.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
But to the victor belong the spoils.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Try the back bedroom.
Try the closet.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
You fucked me, Diego.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
And Diego?
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Tough spot.
Not mad.
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
What do you guys want?
Figured what out?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Tuna.
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
Why are you smiling?
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Better than you.
Are we gonna split up?
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
But I've got school.
Swear on my life.
Shhhh.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Okay, George.
Yes, I do.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
Dien Bien Phu?
Don't move, Hacene.
I don't even know your name yet ...
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
I think it'll be a success ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
Good evening, sir.
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
It could've happened to anyone.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Thanks, Mister D.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Then you can go.
What'd he die of?
But there's more?
A massive cardiac arrest.
Yes.
Increase his heart rate.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
Aren't they all?
Back off, John.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
You get his statement?
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
I had some papers to pick up.
I assume his girlfriend.
Six years.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
About a year and half ago.
I had bypass surgery.
She left me.
Thank you.  The State rests.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Yes -- several times.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
No.
Oriental medicine.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Yes.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Then -- those are not your own words?
We dated for about a month last year.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
Yes -- he did.
What changed?
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
It's okay.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Yeah.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
She's mistaken.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
You're a monster.
That wasn't the deal.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
She allegedly humped him to death?
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
Why didn't you come to me?
That's too bad.
Sorry.
Daddy -- stop it!
What time did you leave?
No -- never.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Oh Jesus.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
No treasure maps, huh?
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
Oh, yes.
They got heat in Michigan.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
Hmm-mmm.
Maybe it's because I live here.
After the divorce.
Oh! You caught me.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
Want another cigarette?
No, your kids.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
And clean.
I feel so embarrassed.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
No.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Yes! Hi.
Oh, sure. Great.
Oh, how is he?
No. I can't. Not yet.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
Yes, thanks.
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
No one's asking you to!
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
Sure.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
I don't remember!
WHAT!
You people really don't like dogs.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Then what do you care?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Just some flies.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
Go for it.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Damned if I know.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Climb out to where?
Wh-wh-whooo?
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
We met.
You mean as opposed to your life?
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
You moved into this block?
I manage them.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
You were just a kid.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
What building?
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
Yeah, you heard of him?
Not that I remember.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
No thanks.
That building?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Ours!
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Know what?
All right!  Where's the key?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where's what?
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
What are you going to do with it?
There's no time.
Why?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
All right, Caesar.
But it could be anywhere.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
Caesar, this is crazy.
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Just hurry.
He can't kill you --
Not until he has the money!
I'm listening.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Oh, right.
Why?
Caesar, you still got the money?
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Yeah, that's it.
This is the police, ma'am.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
I knew it.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
Not exactly.
He said you lost something.
Sure.
A beer.  Of course.
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Why?
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
You have to ask?
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
Almost five years.
Shit, here we go.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
Even though he knew about you?
Mickey?
Do you think you know me like that?
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
Does the case lock?
Yeah.
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
I thought you were never going to do that.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
I don't know.
Right.
Yeah, I know...

Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
-- sir? --
Who?  Who came?
That'd be great.
It's a little late for that.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
I know that.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
Where are we?
Looks familiar?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.

If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
So get the hell out of here.
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
-- I'm on it --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- we're evacuating the building --
I don't remember Zurich.
What have you done to my flat?
...elephoned sir.
...ditioning.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
...Yer nostril?
... ere please.
... get to it.
What? You mean you've got ...
What do I have to do.
You don't have to sing it.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
I'm waiting for my daddy.
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
You sound worried.
Even later.
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Yes, thanks.
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
I'm sure you have
So how ...?
What has Tuttle done?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Shut up!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
If you say so.
Ah.
It's you ... it's you ...
Good!
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
I didn't like it.
Really.
Well, all wars do -
Who will?
Oh ... Jesus!
Your face ... are you hurt?
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Don't do anything silly.
Information Retrieval.
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
Next of kin!
27156789/074328/K.
You are good to me Sam.
Yes.
Yes.
A woman eh? I see.
This is your dream girl, is it?
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
Mistake?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
No, sir.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
We'll be back.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Are you saying this is illegal?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
No. Wait here.
Time to go.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
What if there is no tomorrow?
You can trust me on this one.
Sleeping in the back.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
Mary, we really have to go.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
I should be going. I just quit.
Just take it easy.
Dead.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
What?
I guess there's always a chance.
You never know.
At least he's got people around him.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Yes.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
Because you can barely walk.
I need to sit down a minute.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I quit! I'm through!
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
How can that be? He was getting better.
He was tough. You did all you could.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Yes.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
I've taken that into consideration.
What do you want to break?
Okay, whatta I do?
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Faster!
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
And the rule was...
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
What?
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
Why?
Yes.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
No.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
No!!!!!
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Speaking.
Really?
Your hair's a little funny.
Stop it.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
So I quit.
No.
What is she shooting?
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
Yes.
I spent a fortune on this.
We could...
He said something about...
Bad manners.
One's enough.
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Oh.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
It's not.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
I like "godsend."
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Uh-huh.
Hey?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Because you're nuts.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
Good night??!
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
That's yes?
You fucking...
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
You want to come?
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Go ahead -- what?
I can't be.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
Not anymore!
I just might.
I'm going home!
You're breaking my concentration!
Anything new?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Carla...
Oh...
Yes Walter.
Thank you.
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
What are you trying to say?
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
What?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
When did you make this, Walter?
I'm honored to know this man.
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
I admit it.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
I do the research.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Yeah, right outside the door!
Well I was uh, just looking...
What is it, your laundry?
I didn't mean to.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well...
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Well, w-what did you do?
Uh, hi.
Uh, sure.
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Hiya Maxwell.
Why not?
Really?
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Litter, yeah!
What's with you?
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
Let me in.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
It's the news, Buffy.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Jealous?
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
I am so sure.
You guys are thrashed.
Yeah.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
No, you're not.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
For the dance.
I should have known.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
I'm glad you came.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Nice ensemble!
'Just remember you're in training, son'
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
I'm looking for you, actually.
To bring you... your birthright.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Yes.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
We wait for Robert to wake up.
I have cheerleading squad.
Our purposes.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
And where are they now?
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Nicole...
I don't understand.
Oh, baby!
Buffy?
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
What is she...
He is so bald.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
Switch nostrils?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
Nuke?!
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
No, no, it was great.
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
I'm trying to play with your body!
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
I did.
He's a virgin.
Crash, I didn't think you--
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
That's my job too.
You're pulling your hips out.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Aren't we all?
I want to be had.
You okay?
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
Yeah...you a witch?
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Ninety-five miles an hour...
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Who's he play for?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
If you believe in Voodoo.
It was a cocksucking call!
Beg me!
You're a cocksucker!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
But he ain't seen my heat--
What?
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Jesus.
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
You too...Meat.
I ain't hitting a man first.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
We'll be praying for you.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
He's lying.
I was in the building!
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
But what happens when they do find out?
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
It's a pity in this...
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Excuse me.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Yeah.
Hold on a second.
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
702 472 1862.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Okay.
I don't know.
Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
Listen...
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Between...
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
I'll be honest with you.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Yeah.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
...to me.
She came to talk to me...
It's none of my business?
I see you, you motherfuckers.
What people?
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
And what'd she want?
It's me.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
I'll come by.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
Call security.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Thanks a lot.
Good luck.
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
Uh-huh.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
But as much as they loved her...
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
What do you mean?
Pretty serious.
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Okay?
He needed some clothes.
Yeah.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
What'd you have?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
You want your jewelry?
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
I'm not -
Not gonna let me in?
Oh, you are...
How many kids do you have?
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Mm.
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
I didn't give 'em the m-
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
Shut your mouth!
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Sam?
Hey.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
...fuckin' jerk-off.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Now move along.
Here we go!
For what?
How are you?
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
I understand.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
Yeah.
Want me to take this for you? 
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Am I right?
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
You're so nice. 
It's all right.
I'll be there.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Get lost?
Come on! 
I love you.
Promise?
It means I got the money.
Here.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
Are they out now?
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
All right.
She asleep?
I took care of everybody.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
So are we.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
They'll do it.
Yeah.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
No more! You see? Watch!
Fuck you!
Ch-Charlie M!
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
You sure?
Yeah.
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
Denying?
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
Having a good time?
It's okay. Let her go.
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
You're probably right.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Even the skylight?
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
Absolutely.
Now he'll be up all night...
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
Enough.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Taking messages.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
I didn't hurt you.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
Or relieve me of it later.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
What do you keep making me out to be?
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
What am I supposed to do?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
You don't understand.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
And that was the end of it?
Pictures.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
That's not her.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Even if you found us -- what then?
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Lucky for them they didn't.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
I can't do it.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
There isn't any such person.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
I thought it was inspired.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Stop talking like that!
The money, Nels ... ?
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Naturally.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
Keep talking.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Some loyalty.
Just relax.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I still don't see you.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
There's two police cars now.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I thought you'd know me by now.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
How do you know?
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
From here on, I dish it out.
Then why doesn't she?
How?
See what, Dil?
Persistent.
Ask him yourself.
Saw it, Dil.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Fucking mad!
She's not a tart.
In a way.
The accent, I suppose.
Jimmy?
Not me.
Yes, thank you.
Where?
Jesus.
Shouldn't I go?
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
What do you think?
He did sometimes.
Yeah.
I'm thinking of your man.
I have to talk to her, Col --
Do you care, Jimmy?
You mean that?
You think that's wise?
When?
Know what, honey?
Are you pretending yet?
Please, Jimmy.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Not at all, honey.
Okay.
You following me?
More than that.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
I'm sorry.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
Prescription. For my condition.
Jimmy?
I suppose I tried.
He asked me to see were you all right.
Let them come then.
I like you, DIl
Whatever you say, Dil.
Love you, Dil.
Fergus.
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Yes. Say hello to Col --
Stop it, Dil --
Thirty-five.
Carnations.
You know her, Jimmy?
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
Need to go across the water.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
I heard.
I know.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Och, you do, Fergie.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Thanks.
I told him.
Peter.
Aye, I do, Peter.
Right.
How is it a farce?
I can smell her perfume.
Do what?
You want to bet?
What?
Don't you think of it, fucker.
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
Absolutely not.
Suppose you could say that.
Why did you sign up?
Best game in the world.
I'll bear that in mind.
Tree.
Yeah?
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Doesn't matter where.
Having a pint in the Rock.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
It's as simple as that?
If they kill me --
How can I?
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
A story.
No.
Got to catch me first --
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Tell me, Jody
Whatever you say, Jude...
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
What about it?
It's all right -- look.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
Adam --
I love you, Adam.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Look.
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
I heard you, I heard you.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
No thanks.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
But --
No.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
No.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
That's the idea.
It's all right with us --
Reggie?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Yes, but we're divorced.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Okay.
You did.
Oh. 
That sounds like their problem.
Tuesday.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
No.
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
I don't believe it.
Well!
Go on.
What do you mean?
You mean, you're a thief?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
I'm afraid it is important.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
In money.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
Here's ten.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
Not unless we're blind.
I don't know anything.
Swiss.
He didn't have one.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
And this?
No, Jean-Louis.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Now you're angry.
How do you know?
Charles is.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
I don't know where to go.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Starting tonight?
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
How do you shave in there?
That's all.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Yes?
Wha -- what do you want?
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
Please stop -- please!
Ça alors! From Charles?
The American Embassy.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
We will separate -- you look over there.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
Who invited you?
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
As fucking if.
It won't happen again.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
Run!
No. I'll handle this.
She's still a virgin.
This will relax her.
You know where I can find her?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
Daddy....
What?
Really?
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
Does she fuck?
He says he loves me.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
What?
Ok.
I can't right now.
Twenty eight years ago.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Hi princess.
The library. I'll be fine.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
How could you?
Who were they?
Did you want one?
They're tasty.
So are you.
But you don't really mean it.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
ROD!

Why don't I--?
 No.
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.

Peace.
You want cash?
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
Come on!
You stole this truck.
Kiss my ass!
...-cho and a hijack-...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
All right, you got it.
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...we can make it.
Okay. 
Goddamn!
Come on, old...
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Holy--!


Taking it down the hill.
Then stay...
No!
Oh, no!
 All right.  Hey.

Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
So you took his...
You know.
We were nationally  ranked.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
I mean, if that gun was...
...-er.  It was your friend...
Hey.   Mason.
You all right?

Are you all right?
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
 Okay.

What?

Okay.
I'm gonna kill him.

 
It's working.
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
 There's gotta be...
Let's go!
Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Hello.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
Thank you.
Ooh.

...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
This country trained me to kill...
Well, well, well.
Three seconds.  One...
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
We do need your truck.

 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
However, you are also non-en-...
...including the permanently extreme.


Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
It's too...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
Almost quaint.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...

There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Tie a fly...
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
 No...

Yeah.
Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.

Jake, for Christ's sake.
So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
Yeah.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
How did you find out?
She's fine.
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
Oh, my, yes.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Just bring your checkbook.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
I don't know...
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
I said okay, Jake.
The apple core club.
Summer colds are the worst.
How'd you get past the guards?
No?
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
And why's that?
C'mon I'll show you.
Too late for what?
What for?
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
I'll stop by.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
How did you find out?
You were seeing someone, too.
No reason.
No, not for that one.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
What dam?
No.
Is that unusual?
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
Why?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
He owns it. You know?
You saw my fa... father? When?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Including the death of your husband?
You bastard.
You mean she just found out?
Aren't you coming back with me?
Sure.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
Katherine.
How about a plane?
Where can we go?
He's in the dark room.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
You'll find one of those people.
Ida Sessions.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
Oh, good.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Help yourself.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Yes?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
It's not completely dry.
Mr. Gittes...
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Since lunch.
No, you have a press agent do it.
Well, you never know, do you?
Why'd she run away?
So I can have these? 
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Come in, Alfredo.
Progress! It always arrives too late!
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
Hi. Why are you running?
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
No...
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Where is he?
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
What does it say there?
I didn't see that.
Two cents.
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
He made an awful lot of money.
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
You're no Venus de Milo.
Thanks.
In the water.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I'm not sorry.
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
Thanks.
You can't.
Can you prove it isn't?
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
Yes, sir.
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
It's been a tough day.
What're you going to do, Charlie?
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Good.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
Why is she leaving me?
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
You won't be lonely, Charles...
That must have been love.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
I had a toothache.
He married you, didn't he?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Am I sure about what?
Are you serious?
This? How long have you been smoking?
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
I take it she likes the guy.
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
Just now.
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
How do you know that?
No, you're not really getting married?
How like her.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
You lie.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
I hear that's a rather popular date.
He's your fiancé.
I'm just kidding.
I left like an hour ago.
Like what?
Was it you?
What time was this?
We did.
Excuse me?
I can pass!
I'll assess all I want!
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Are you open?
What's your point?
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Peptic ulcer.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
Go open the sore.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Oh, my God.
You think things would be any different now?
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
Return of the Jedi.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
There's more?
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
Why not?
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
I know.
I don't back down.
You know what pisses me off the most?
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
We're not playing in the street.
Exactly. They drank it all.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
That's embarrassing?
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
And this is what you rented?
Living proof.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
I'm not.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
What responsibility?
As if it's that easy.
Oh, like your life's any better?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Leave her out of this.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Thanks.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Yes.
Thirty-fire.
I know I can bench more than that!
Jesus Christ, what next?
Excuse me?
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
He died in the bathroom.
We were going to start again, I think.
Meaning?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Hunhh? Nothing.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Something wrong?
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
Twelve.
Three including you.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Why do you say that?
I'm serious...
Please calm down.
Dante...
Let it go...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
Sure.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
Randal...?
What?
You said you were here all day?
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Because he's out of shape.
Yeah!
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
I don't know.
I copy.
Where's the radio?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Look, I know--
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Fine, I guess...
That's it, you look like a professional.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
You couldn't.
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
Hal knows what he's doing.
What are you doing here!?
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Breathtaking.
Up ahead.
This rope is sixty years old!
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
Don't let me fall!
I don't know.  I don't know.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
Never could save a thing.
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
There is.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Anyone else following?
There.  You blind?
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Then it's a deal.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Ask the questions.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
We can't and he knows it.
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Good morning, Walt.
Richard Travers.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
I've been cured.
Try the wine!
No. She's dead!
Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Well, shall we get down to it?
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Aye.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
No, sir.
Lice?
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
We're going to friends now, sir.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
You mean like going to the pictures?
Yes!!!
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Indeed.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Are you feeling better?
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Thank you.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
You psychic?
Most of the time.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Just had one.
When was the last time you took one?
How often you go?
Sure thing.
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
Federal?
Can you finish on schedule?
Twenty five?
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
Try?
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
Jesus, what is with this guy?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
Twenty-four minutes.
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Me, specifically?
I'm cool.
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
What?
I think so.
It's a mess.
South Central.
Tonight it is.
Yes.
Play music.
What'd he do to you?
Who was he?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
How?
Yeah.
What?
I listen to classical.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
I'm not catching a melody.
Leave me alone.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Jazz.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Yeah?  What happened?
What happened?
In case <u>who</u> checks?
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
Why?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
That's what you said...
What'd they do?
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Who?
Why the hell not?
Just drop me off.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Motive?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
What is?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Them who?
Yeah.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
What is it with you and the space program?
This would be it?
Pretty scary, huh?
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
How'd he die?
Not this again.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
Realized what?
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Okay, I will.
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Thanks.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Not today.
This way.
You go.  Send me a postcard.
Where were you the day he died?
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
They'll trace it.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
You saw me standing alone ...
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Only on the football field.
We're very specialized.
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
Terminal?
And what did I say?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Yes, that's right.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
This doesn't make sense.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
Tell me about it.
Your call.  Have a good night.
Yes, sir.
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
Tell me.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Meaning...
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
I don't understand.
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
This... seemed best.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Put it on speakers.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
But what do I say?
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
Now... you go home.
No.  Please.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
A page-break signal.  A period.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
And?
Actually --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Jesus --
Peter.
It's really happening.
I'm -- I'm fine.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Yes.  Very much.
If you came back.
Really.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
Hi.
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Yeah.
That's good: he earned it.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
Borrowin'.
Tramp! Beautiful!
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
I call.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
He's gonna be awright.
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
Fifty's a nice round number.
We got it locked in the sock.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Take it easy, Drag.
On my own.
Thass right. Just play it...
Gettin' up, Carr.
Cuter.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
No. No chains either.
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
Andy?
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
You know I can't do that.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
If he's not out, why are they here?
For months... last October.
How do you know that?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
Well, thanks.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
I'll get a locksmith.
<u>What</u>?...
What else?
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Oh, I know.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Just horseshit luck.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
You came in there with this attitude...
My promise.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Helen... excuse me, we...
Right.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
I know.  Get out here.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Helen Hudson...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
You're not envious?
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
One of your suitors?
I'd like to go back. James...
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Yes.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
I can drive.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
I miss Beast a lot, too.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
But everything's OK?
Truly.
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
I know.    I know.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
When did you start smoking?
I've already made arrangements.
A deal's a deal.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
I answered these questions last night.
By color.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Anything interesting.
No rounds for another three hours.
What are the delusions like?
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
But I do.     I love you, too.
Home free.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
So, it's over?
I better make a list.
Open up.    I want to see.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
It's sex time.
No.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Michael, take it easy.
I think I should call someone.
Well then why'd it happen?
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
That's a big question.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
So, what do you say, Let?
No...
I start on Monday.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
What?   This?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
You're there now?
It's Daniel.
Good.   I'm good.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
I assume you want something?
Half the tapes.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
Where are you from?
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
You want Zero to kill him?
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
I can't believe you didn't check.
What for?
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
Man, I can get anything.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Everything?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
The Holiday Hotel.
I don't know.     I didn't look.
I was told to take what we have and go.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
What are we going to do, take a taxi?

No!
The hell it is.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Yeah, I dig him.
What?
Wait here.
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
What does arresting us get them?
Thanks.
No.
Stick around and find out.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Then leave her to me.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
You're probably right.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Come and get it if you can.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
It has.  How's business?
Fine.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
But Wudan does not accept women.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
But don't be too lenient.
A murderer?
What does it say?
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
You don't say.
Fucking A, my friend.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
How 'bout the morgue?
Fun -- look at that guy...
Who?
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
You don't even remember...
Another jolly nickname?
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Shelly?
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Fine with me.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Is he inside?
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Annette Harrison.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
From who?
No.
A friend wrote me.
Thank you.
What? Another letter from your friend?
Wait, don't hang up.
You must take me for a real idiot.
Not at all. Have a seat.
Why are you doing this?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Where did you say she's from?
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
No.
I... I don't think you want to know.
Well... not exactly.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
You think he'll like it?
Of course. I'm not a monster.
You promised to let me kiss you.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I know.
Same time next week?
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Honey, is something wrong?
Baby?  Right on time.
And you think she bought it?
No.
Ronald?
It's Kathryn.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
Outstanding.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Be more specific.
Shhh.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
But who will they turn to for help?
Yeah.
What's your problem?
She shot you down.
Oh yes.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
I accept. Now get out.
Get out!
I need to talk to Annette.
Do you know where she is?
We played backgammon?
Excuse me?
Oh... no thank you...
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
You're a lucky guy.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
Sometimes.
But it's already come true.
Yes, darling,
I think I should.  3000W?
I'm never unfair.
Well, you know where it is.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
They ran away.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
Because she is my friend.
No.
You called me by my name.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
I can not tell you.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
A princess?
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
That's the clever way to do it.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Why hasn't he got a head?
Look at me.
My daughter died long ago.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
Come away, Amy.

I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Can we get some service here?
I've changed a lot lately.
At Victoria's Secret.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
What else is there?
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
People notice you Frida.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
And she got the medium.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
Okay. I guess so.
No they're not.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Okay, I gotta go.
He's been here all night?
Hide him.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
I really gotta pee.
I didn't have to pee then.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
So pee? Here?
No.
So pay them back and apologize.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Take your shower.
On your desk.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
Intriguing?
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Okay, you busted me.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
What's that supposed to mean?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
What? Is there someone else?
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
What about... those guys... I might have...
Thanks.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
How big?
Packages of money.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
You're some catch Lloyd.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
And he was missing an arm.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
This one walk you home too?
Like a vampire or some shit?
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
Loose ends?
Just like that?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
Who?
What?
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
No...  No doctor...
But I...
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
That's easy.  You...
Don't worry about it.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Alan
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Fine.
... What?
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
I was a senator, you know.
Is that everybody?
And...
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Bob...
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
That'd be great.
Oh my gosh...
Why?
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
The Vice-President...
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Mind if I sit down?
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
I don't mind.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
I know.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
We're working on it.
What about the intro?
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
All set.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Quiet!
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
Ain't no place safe.
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
Knox?
Knox Overstreet.
Except sex.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
I'm not?
Doing fine, sir.
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
All right.  I'll second that.
No.
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
Sort of.
But, Chris...
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Are you going with Chet?
Dead Poets honor.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
YAWP!
A madman.
A crazy madman.
Nothing wrong with research.
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Yeah.
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
I'm calling her!
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Yes sir.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
A play, dummy.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Yea, art thou there?
Yes.
We have to make it to the third deck...
Which question is that?
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
You're going to have to get a new one.
Dead.
I told you...
That's where my boat's moored.
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
You hear that?
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
He's not coming...
Forget them...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Me??
I don't know...you got what we need?
A little to the left...
Line it up now, nice and easy...
How does an island sound to you?
Joey...
Joey...
Nowhere...
You want some too?
Maybe plans changed...
Nothing.
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
Fuckin' A!
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
You're full of shit.
So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
It's Nick!
Yeah.
Well... you remember Cynthia?
It won't open.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Worse since she talked to who?
Yeah.
You talk to him?
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
But you must come in.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
Linda, yeah.
No.
Oh, well...
Who's got the ammo?
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Linda, Linda...!
Sure.
No.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
Nick.
Who the hell knows!
No. No, no.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
From Nam?
Pow.
You got it.
What are you, God?
Forget Sal?
More bullets in the gun?
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
Right.
That's my plan.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Listen, Nick --
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Never one.
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
I'm not voting for you.
And I want Doucet.
Remember my promise.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
He could be brought back.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
Telephone repairman.
Shut up!  Drop it.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
Pass.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
Yes, sir.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
...What are you talking about...?
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
I'm signing off.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
They always are.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
This little thing says I can't.
We will --
Of course I will.
No, thank you -- what's your name?
Lying to you -- Why should I?
Guess there will, if it says so.
And what about Daniel Webster?
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
All right, darling.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Howdy, Hank.
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
You are afraid!
But what becomes of our souls?
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
Well, I'll be -- 
Leave your tongue off of that!
I'm through with you.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Ten throws it is.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
There's no joy in it for me.
Headache -- Squire?
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Oh -- Jabez.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
It shows on your face.
Jabez!
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
All right, Jabez ...
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Wouldn't profit him none.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
You'll be a father any minute now.
Let him try it.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
Of course not --
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
You can talk to me ...
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
Married.
But meant her moving here.
So, why didn't you come?
That is Christmas music.
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Okay.
Go fuck yourself.
I told you...
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Sure.  Follow me.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Oh...Where does he live?
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
Thanks...partner.
I'm here, cowboy.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
I still feel like shit.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
Bullshit.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Yessir.
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
No.  I never smile any more.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
You're crazy.
Why you going to Algeria?
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
They're okay.
I got Sal.
Call me whatever you want.
I frisk you?
Come on.  I want you to see something.
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
Sonny, come on out!
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
We're bringing in your wife...
He's all doped up.
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
Special to me, too.
Sure - we like you.
You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
We like you, too.
What now, Sonny?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
What about Howard?
You were terrific, too!
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You stopped?  Why?
My body?  What for?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Fuck him - let him out!
Get 'em in the vault!
But I want to know what you think.
Dead or alive?

Wyoming.
Everybody!  Back here!
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Okay.
Okay, Sonny.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Okay, when do I get them?
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
I am.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Yeah - it looks real official.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
Oh.  Run.
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>
What about your toe?
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>

That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken.

Do you know where Danang is?
...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!
In theory.
Real fast.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
So, in other words, you are not down.
Jade, I still love you.
Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
Ask Sal.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
OK.  OK.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
I'm in here.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
What are you so worked up about?
He's just being nice.
He's completely innocent.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Sorry, comb got caught.
How are you holding up in this weather?
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Don't worry about it.
What is?
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Talk to your son.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Depends.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Where we goin'?
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
You keep it.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Come in then.
Your memory is really getting bad.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Meda.  Meda.
Eddie Murphy.
You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
Ya like him, huh?
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
On the rebound.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
Forget it, Mookie.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
I like Mookie a lot.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
Don't start on me today.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
In the new library there.
HARRY Dunne.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
What? No! Look.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Well la de da.
No, I'm fine thanks.
I don't follow.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
Cool.
You're it.
No.
The principal.
The second R is silent.
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
She did not.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
Don't look directly at him.
They can't be real.
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
And my mouph is frozen.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Sucks for you.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
That's the one I wanted.
Hey, where'd you go?
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
Special Needs class.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
Looks like the best man won.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Uh-oh. Harry?
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Yes you are. 
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
Who's there?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
Everything. Just for the record.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
Piter.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
Nothing.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
Yes?... How was your journey?
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
Is this what you seek?
Paul!!  Paul!!
They said you were dead.  They said...
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
Your Reverence.
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
No.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always.
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Pain.
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
They tried and died....  Jessica!
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
It's a pleasure...
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Do you want me to get it for you?
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
That's good.  I could use the money.
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Goulash.
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
I never said I could ad-lib...
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
Eddie, you screwed up.
So why didn't you do it?
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Don't let me slow you down.
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Ed, it was only one review.
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
This is my way of telling you --
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Oh, just like in the script!
I don't know.  It's so much money...
That's ridiculous.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
What other sixty-thousand?
Well, uh, if I could I would...
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Hruphh...?
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
So you're not a fruit?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Tits.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
There's still a sex-change --
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Um, I guess --
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
I just picked them up on the way over...
No! I love sex with girls.
The poor girl's out of a job.
Yes?
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
I don't know.
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
NOOOOO!!!
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Isn't that the same thing?
At what point?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Come on...
Yeah, so... ?
Al!!
Went --
I'm moving out.
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Um, yeah -- thanks.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
What if Shari's the dream?
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Yes?
Really? They were..
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Right, right...
Right.
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
He made a mistake.
Mm.
Holy sh--
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
And what did he come back now for?
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
It was horrible. He called me up.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
Ma...
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
It's... okay
I missed you.
Yeah, well...
Why?
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Shari...
Really? 
So?
No. It's your fault.
What did you do to your hair?
What are you drunk?
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
Screw off.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
Oh, Jesus.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
Cassie...
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Me?! That's you!
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
It's Ed.
Oh, man! So...
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Good?
Ed?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
pierdo.
pierdes.
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Thank you.
Here, get down.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
What?
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Uh-huh.
Yes?
My house.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Walt needs to see you.
I did it.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Door was open.
We'll let it run awhile
You're there.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
What?
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Sure, Tracy.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
Yes.  But do you know?
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Call me Dudley.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Lynn.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
I got her address.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
More.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
They shot him in his library.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
What's this all about, lad?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
Bud White's been here?
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
Right now, before I back down.
What's Dudley's scheme?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Yeah, it's subtle.
Something good?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What's wrong, Trash?
A bootleg...
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Be careful, Danny.
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
Yeah.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
One-twenty.
Look, my wife is understandably--
How'd you have the manpower to--
Why'd you leave?
It really is.  Did you find anything?
<u>Here</u>?!
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
What if--
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Can you help me?
Is that good?
Why?
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
Because I don't know.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Yes sir.
No.
It's okay.
How could you let me find out like this?
Robert--
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Stacy--
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
What is it?
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Not that much.
When do I get to meet him?
It's how he works.
Other than me.
He doesn't work that way.
Will you hang on just a second.
We're screwed.
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
Brill.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Why?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
What about jewelry?
The blender?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Calm down.
I have a family.
Yeah?
Are you still in Crystal City?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
He got hit by a bus.
What the hell does it mean?
Fuck you.
We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
We believe?
Lyle?!
What about the tape?
Do you have visual?
What's your ETA?
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Puffed cheese?
Yes sir.
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
What do you mean, poetry?
I'd like you to have them.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
Yes.  Absolutely.
No, but I think I do.
I believe you still have my book.
Now.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
This is empty, just coming!
Shall we be all right?
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
A surprise, he said.
We've got to get you out of here.
Don't talk.
I know.
Still a car.
You too.  Good luck!
What?
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Right.
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
Okay.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
So was my Patient.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
Ask him.
Me?
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
To arm-twisting.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Are you remembering more?
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
I've met you before.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
You get Hardy.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
You loved him.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Then come with me.
He's sleeping.
Does he have to go?
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
How awful.  What will you do?
I don't think so.
Then you were married?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
Bingo.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
Why didn't I think of that?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
Who am I?
Then don't.
I'll call an ambulance.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Possibly.
Can you follow simple directions?
Look on the back. What do you see?
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
I never carry...baggage.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
That's because I wanted them to!
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
Charged?
One more item--not on the check list.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Terrified. Still am.
It's a party.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Ready.
Duh.
What?
It's your mistake.
A billion dollars.
Everything.
I'd taken the Mask?
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
It's no good without the argon gas.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Have really held you under?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
FUCKING THING!!!
The disc is still in there.
I sincerely hope not.
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
You gave them the eight billion.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
All of 'em?
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Yes?
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
Right.
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
They did?
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
If you hadn't used profanity --
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
That's crazy -- why not?
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Really?  It makes me sick.
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
What?  Who?
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
The extortion, the threats ...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
How come you're not eating?
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Why not?
How?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
What do you mean?
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
Nothing.
Keep your voice down.
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
What's that?
I can't leave my job, George.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
That's okay.  I understand.
What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
What's going on?
Yes.  It's called accountability.
Have you been logging on?
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
Uh-huh?
Next week.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
Ben ... Ben ...
Okay, okay.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
What happened?
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
I take it back.
Good.
What is it?
How do I look?
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Where?
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
I always said you were a gentleman.
Hyperdrive.
I'm sorry too.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
I didn't say anything?
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Are the coordinates set?
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Let's go.
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
Han's leaving?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
I thought I was in good shape.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
That is why you fail.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Only what you take with you.
Free your mind and return he will.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
They look pretty docile.
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
Go on now. Do as I say.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
You told me he was dead.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Not anymore.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
What's the little black box do?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
No.
It's history. I gotta go.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Right over there.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
You're running out of time.
Give me the prototype.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
I cannot--
...I saw nothing.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
The dragon! There...
...of course...
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
You freed it, son?
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
Ye...
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
There is one.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
I am the desert, where water disappears--
You didn't ask!
Well what's wrong?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
I see, your excellency.
Thank you your excellency.
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
Hi, how'd your day go?
We still don't know.
Want to ask him?
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Of course. Have you got a pen?
What's her name?
You're a nice man.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
Please go away.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Sure did.
Why, I don't understand?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
What else?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Father?
Um........Stuff.
Your kidding?
When can I have one?
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
I don't know
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Well I heard differently.
I don't know, I just thought.
St. Mike's.
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
What's playing.
Who's in it?
You might loosen the straps then.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
It would bring us together.
Holy water.
Why?
In the face of the enemy.
The Lord be with you.
Amen
Amen
Her heart.
Only what I read in the papers.
I once did a paper on it
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Are you tired?
Be silent!
Fuck him!!!
Do you have an appointment?
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
No.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
It's all there.  Both nights.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
You bring trunks, Jack?
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
How will he eat?
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
Am I late?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Like an angel.
Huh?
Fuck him.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
You got weird kids, Frank.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
Terrific.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
What?
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
It's not gonna hurt you.
How about these?
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
I'll take my chances.
First night?
Right.
Good idea.
Yeah.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
Because I can hear it.
Fine.
Two hours ago!
No. Why?
He was wearing a suit.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
The tenth's out.
No.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
Seventy-one
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Later.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
This'll kill 'em.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
All right.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
This is where the auditions were.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Right.
Piece of cake.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Yeah.
Tell her.
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Huh?
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
Yes, well, they are.
Uh, well ...
Thanks, Lloyd.
I'll call you.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Job.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Baker.
Regular hours are eight to five.
The name's Baker --
Black.  Labrador.
I suppose.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Nothing personal --
Every year.
Like a baby. You?
Better than that.
Nothing.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Soap?
No kidding?
Nervous?
So, what happened?
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Another five years, huh?
Sounds big.  What's he do?
What happened to the donut king?
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Good to see you, Ma.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
Drive.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
A few blanks?  Like what?
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
It's important.
How come?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
I'm going to have you fired.
Like you know anything about it.
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
No problem.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
-- I've got to study.
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
Call me spontaneous.
Great.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Excuse me?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
I don't know.  Maybe...
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Big Ed’s.
So could you write down her exact address?
I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
Hey...
What the hell is happening to me?!
You mean because you thought I was cocky I’m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
You know what the word glimpse means, J? It’s by nature an impermanent thing.
Get out, I call 911.
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Maybe you’re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Uh huh...
Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
For us, Kate.
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Because you’ll be here.
Funny, Jack.  I’m laughing on the inside.
No, she’s not.
...my feet are hurtin’...
She got those shoes...
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
You had a heart attack?
If you want to look at it that way...
Oh yeah, you’re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I’m gonna take you to that special place...
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
Zeena...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
I’ll fix it.  I’ll go out right now and get you something.  I’ll make it right.
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
What are you talking about, Jack?
But I’ve done some good things too, haven’t I?
Don’t worry about it, Jack...
Not with what they pay me...
Jack.
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Do I know you?
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
Okay, I’ll take them...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
I'd like that, too.
Congratulations. The La Guardia flight’s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Relax, it's casual.
You'd never know it.
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
Oh, he did.
What do you mean "complete"?
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Reed, we're running out of time.
Never better.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
It's been changed.
Great minds think alike.
Passion.
And reverse the mutations --
I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Raising the shields.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Phase Two.
The less time, the better.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
But big enough for us...
Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
But I did. I'm positive!
That's what they pay me for.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
You left something out.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Quite a piece of plumbing.
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Uh -- what?
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
What do you mean?
No Jean, no money!
...What're you talking about?
No.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
My wife! What the - how's -
What the heck d'ya mean?
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, but that TruCoat -
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Mr. Mohra?
Uh-huh.
Ya got that right.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Can you be any more specific?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Uh-huh.
Yeah!
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
No, no, fax is -
Know who this is?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
My patience is at an end.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
2:30.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
Ah, dammit!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Well - it's cold, Margie.
Yah?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Gotta go?
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Aw, Norm.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Oh, pretty good.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Just a Diet Coke.
No, no, that's fine.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
I always liked ya so much...
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
His wife?
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Yah.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
We've got a -
Yah?
Uh-huh.
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
They're real good.
Yah.
I love you, Norm.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
He's at Norstar.
Where's Tyler?
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
He was killed in action.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Really, what's that?
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
Some of it, yes.
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Dynamite?
Who do you think could've done this?
I'd like to thank the academy...
Sure.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
Should we?
I suppose.
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
It suits you.
Good.
Chloe's dead.
It was the smart move on her part.
What... ?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
You are an insane person.
I'm sorry, but I...
Yes.
Who's this?
What?
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Being clever.
This is how we fill up our lives.
And, now it's gone.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Do what you like.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
You get the idea.
Is it?
Call what off?
Anyone?
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Doesn't matter.
Shatner.  William Shatner.
Any historical figure.
Good answer.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
Nothing.  Do what you like.
Tell him!
Imagine how he feels.
Hey.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
Nothing.
... is over.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
Answer me, Tyler.
This isn't possible...
The house is rented in your name.
What about Marla?
Um, well... technically, no.
You... you can't be serious about this.
I can't let you...
This is not about martyrdom.
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
Defuse the bomb, please.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
What?
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
No, please, no, God, no!
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
I...I...
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
I have to save Eugene!
We need to hurry.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
That lucky bastard.
Carter.
Blow me.
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Take my van!
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Yeah?
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Like what?
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
I...I don't know.
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
I'm... really sorry.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
As in flannels and plaids?
Thirty-nine.
Thirty-nine.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
I don't.
Look, there's something you should all know.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
That's a plan.
In Death...
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
Huh?
That's right, buddy.
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
There's the Mekong.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Show me how it operates.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
No cigarettes.
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
Let me see.
Alright.  Home run.
Nothing we can do, man.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
Where's his father?
Nguyen is good boy.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Let's get that tent down!
Not yet.
Christ almighty.
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
Colonel.
I could take it or leave it.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
You threw him out?
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Got any more bread crust?
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
No, I'm fine... really...
You still believe in God?
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
The moron?
And who's Lydia?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
What does that mean?
He just needs some clothes?
Thank you very much.
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
My agent.  I called my agent.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Where?  Maybe we can.
I... I was just leaving.
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
I was nine in the sixties.
What girl?  I didn't notice.
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
My name is Parry.
The Little People?
They work for Him.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
So what? You going to help me?
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Sure...
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
It sounds exciting.
You don't have to say that.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Shhh...
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
I'm not.
You treat me like I was.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I love it.
Shut up! All of you!
Is what you?
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Fill it up.
Palm Apodaca.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Don't, then.
You know who it once belonged to?
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Who's Van Oost?
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Yeah, me, too...
Tita, I've got to go...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
I don't know.
No, thanks...
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Where's Catherine?!
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Tomorrow, then.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
I'll be back later...
Oh. You have to tell me that.
At game, Carl.
All right, let's have a rematch.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
It is true.
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Steam.
Is it true?
Victor.
Hi.
Nothin'.
No.  What you do today?
Of course.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
I kissed those girls.
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Wussup, Victor.
I got punished, man.
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Eddie from Compost?
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Nineteen.
Not luck. They don't want me.
Can I ask anybody now?
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Thank God, the police.
Well, which one?
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Oh, he was dying for years.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Just relax....
Breathe easy...
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Okay. Some idea.
I'm serious, Sam.
Affirmative.
You don't have a piece of the action?
Nothing. They're still there.
Thank you.
That's it?
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Come on in.
Where are you going?
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
I know.
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Yeah. Maybe.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Charmed.
Sure, all drifters do.
Take it where?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
You doing a story on this guy?
Yeah.
Nothing to it.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
How long have they been married?
John Ultrarelamensky.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
Please.
It's amazing.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
What is this?
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
But I've seen the deed.
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
I think you better sit down.
I checked. There was no divorce.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Come here.
You shouldn't be here.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
She moved out.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
And a damn fine one, I might add.
What about finding the source?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
My secretary.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
In a minute!
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Excuse me?
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Have what?
But I am...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Yeah, let's bury her.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Johnny's C.D.?
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
No, wait...
Ye-ah.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Did he just say what I think he said?
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
I'm off it!
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Go on, another time, another place.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
What?
Mr. Doyle.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
Who's this --
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
He is not wrong.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
What?
He got off on six.
What's he do?
Yeah, I know.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Where the hell is it?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Drink this.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Suspicion of what?
I can't.
Let yourself in.
We put him to bed for the night.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
I been damn careful up to now.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
What I know is what I told you.
Nothing.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Switches are shorted out.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
Baltimore?
Elvis has left the building.
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
The future guy?
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
I think you know, Frank.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Wait...
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Huh?
What'd you just say?
Uh huh...
What?
What's happening?
What if it's not...
Johnny...?
1998.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
I lost you.
I never knew you, Dad.
I don't understand.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
Tell me.
I'm glad.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
Something happened, something...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
John, he's got my driver's license.
What?
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Sully!  Is that you?
Longbranch...?
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
She's pretty special.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Cool it, Andy.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
Sure.
Yes, man!
This is all the exercise I need...
Your bed.
Hello.  How are you?
Is that so bad?
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
What?
Are you all right, Shelly?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
You promised you'd never ask me.
Stick around and you'll see.
Why don't you help us?
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
It was nothing.
Who's Horace?
Go out and plug the cord back in.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Why?
We're gonna scare him?!
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Happy Friday the 13th.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Uh...yes.  But...
It's just beginning.
No.
'Cause it stinks.
I hope so.
Why?
Boy scouting.
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Yeah, we're here.
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
The what?
Yes.
Twenty.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Maybe you should mind your own business.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Next, you dial a number.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Never.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
Yeah.
Nothing.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
The fire alarm...
Perfectly.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I...I can't...
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
I don't know what to say...
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Hi, Sean.
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
What did you find?
She wants a divorce.
It's over, finished and done with.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Asbestos lining.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
Do not inhale.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Then you should carry a gun.
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
What are you talking about?
I hear Alan's sick.
I talked to her two days ago.
Our Peter?
They'll lose because they're my team.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Daddy, wait.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
That's always been my problem.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
Joanne Bourne.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
They're always winning. Until they lose.
This could be it!
I can't find it.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I know, Pop.
Oh yeah?
Matthew's my grandson.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
I want to believe.
Washed away.
This could be it!
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
You're out of bullets.
hat was this morning.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
You're not making sense.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
I have excellent long-term memory.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
What color?
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
Alla puttanesca.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
He goes to the theater armed.
All the more reason.
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
A great deal.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
That was England.
I congratulate them.
Who's leading them?
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Now is your chance to find out.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Something's not right.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Where do we start?
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
What a relief.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
Any particular reason?
What are you talking about?
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
I'm travelling too.
German, is that you?
How tall are you?
Why not?
I was at home.
Why would we do that?
We were just looking.
In the South Wing.
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
You celebrate, Jerome?
You'll be next.
Of course.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Only every time I'm in here.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
Beynon.
And you got him...
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Yeah.
Better than old times.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
No. It's been a long time.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
Really.
My mind's not on guessing games.
And switched keys.
Fifteen minutes.
I can handle it.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
Let's do it.
El Paso.
Not now.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Whatever happens it's over.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Yeah... I guess it does.
No, I'm afraid not.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
What about you?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
Suit yourself.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Not now.
What's it to you?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
How?
This is my brother's car.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
I know.
Christ, what...
Jack, you're wrong.
Jack...
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
Good evening.
That's nice.
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Nasty.
Brumby.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Not entirely. No.
You've been watching the film.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Working at Woolworths.
Yes.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Where you off to?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
It never is.
No. Really, I am.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
No, you won't.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
No.
No. Are you tired?
How could I stay away?
Jack Carter.
No, I didn't know that.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
Still got a sense of humour?
You should have told me who you were working for.
Sod off.
Yep.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
But they have to be diplomatic.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Shut up.
I'm not?
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
They came in and they, you know...
And now...
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Yes.
That's what I...
Men come work for you...
Someone should hurt them.
Huh.
Yes.
What did you say?
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
You're saying "me."
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
Yes.
What if you don't get caught?
No.
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Because you listened.
How ya doing?
What do you care...?
Huh?
That's...
No.
Was I?
You think so?
In school.
Go to lunch, George.
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Levene!!
You're done, come down, and let's...
Shelly, you blew the last...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
The leads are assigned randomly...
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
And what if you don't close.
Not lately you can't...
Twenty percent.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
I can't split them.
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Who kept the other half?
That was easy, wasn't it?
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
Mmm.
Guess who?
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Kenilworth.
Mm.
What do I...?
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
To change our minds.
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
If we wait till Mon...
Yest...
I told you.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
The power to negotiate.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
She told me not to talk to you.
And the check is...
You going to turn State's?
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Why not?
I'm going home.
Yes.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Just a few days.
I can't.
We have no money for a rug.
She couldn't decide.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
How are the kids?
I got surprises for everybody!
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
Michael...
Because I need MONEY!
No.
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
Not for strangers; for my country.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
Let's go.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Mio fratello.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
I want you to help me, Fredo.
It was hard to have him killed.
Beautiful.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
Chi?
Kay... Kay...
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
But if you're wrong...
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
I know he's in Israel.
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
Do you gamble?
He is, I believe, a brother.
The witness is excused; take him out.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Yes, Michael.
Yes, Michael, it does.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Michael.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Get out of my hotel.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
The money was sent.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
I deny his every charge.
I do not.
I do not.
They feel cheated.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
I thought we would meet alone.
Turnbull is a good man.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
It's important.
No, she's here.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
The same assurance we got from you.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
Yes.
I won't keep you another minute...
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
Weird.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
You mean us?
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Expect nothing fancy.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Your wife?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Huh?
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
But it's just my face you want to draw.
Your family ate dripping?
All right, I guess.
Did anyone laugh?
No.  I could have, though.
Can't today.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
Do you miss it?
Cut it out!
You first.
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
You're the one who started it.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Run for what?
Good.  Let's get dry.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
I'm very sorry.
I don't remember that one.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Elsa?
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
She is beautiful.
One likes to live simply.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
What rumors might those be?
I guess.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Six years ...
Tell me about Kip -
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Who do you think?
Jesus ...
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
Point-five ...
I don't want him hurt...
One more night --
What do you mean -- ?
You know my back.
Something like that -
Your girl works in there ...
Cadillac.
Needs brightening ...
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
Good.
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
C'mon, man ...
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Donny-nothin'!
How you doing, man?
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
What time of year?
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Don't go there, Toby --
Okay --
About what?
What?
Hey, now -
I can handle it --
Me...
You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
The family that steals together, deals together...
Price of doing business...
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
What?
Sure, man --
What for -- ?
Hospital.
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
Where we going -- ?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
On account of me.
Hey -
What's wrong with her -- ?
Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
That what you want?
Oh. Okay. Right.
I think so... They're just... So ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
And Tracy's on the move ...
Yeah ... You -- ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
And the moral of that story is -- ?
No we don't -
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
I'll see you soon --
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
You sure I can't go with ya?
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Not really -
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Checkin' it out
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Why would I get into that?
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
With what?
Where's the stuff?
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
Nah.
He heard.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
What? Come on!
Oh shit.
Fuck you.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Next week.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
No one. I didn't have the number.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
You caught that, huh?
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
Yah, all right...
Shut up.
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
Shut the fuck up.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
Seven.
Somethin's in my room.
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
No students work for me.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
What're you doing?
Hey fuck you.
Half-red, half-black--
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Find out what?
Uh-oh.
I did.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
Good to see you.
I've been busy.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
I need someone with your kind of background.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
I think so.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
--Gerry--
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Come in.
I don't know. India maybe.
I don't got a crush on her.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
What did you think?
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Fine.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
You're kiddin' me.
I don't know.
I guess.
Define that.
Not to me, they're not.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
It sure ain't good.
It's not your fault.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Okay, sounds good.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
We'll do that.
Exactly.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Not tonight.
No.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
I can't go out to California.
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
I'll get Rosasharn.
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
She got to make it.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Sure, but what is this?
Four.
Two.
Got a warrant?
You got dances too?
Goodnight.
Why, you're the preacher!
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
Just around that next bend.
They never wrote you nothing?
I never heard nothin' about it.
I don't know.
You're right!
Women is always tar'd.
Want to work, do you?
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
That's where I get off.
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
I'm ready.
Ya say we're acrost?
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
You promised, Tommy.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
He was a good man.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Then what, Tom?
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
Won't they come out here?
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
Me an' you both.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
Whatsa matter?
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
I never--
Morning.
Yes I do.
In the corporate offices.
Yeah...
It's what I do.
Then express yourself, Bob.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Insane.
Overflowing with love.
It's nice to see you again.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Yep.
Okay... Hold on...
I think they'll probably have booze there.
It's something I do...
Get the fuck outta here.
You're a government spook?
Jesus Christ!
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
You understand the psychology of the job.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Okay.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hey, Bob.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
It was the PLO.
One cannot love and kill.
If he does our job, he's our job.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
That's going to cost.
I'm not happy.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
There's nothing to be done about it.
Never enough.
See you next week.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
That's wonderful, Mom.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
That's too bad.
See you in ten years.
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
You ever just stand still for a minute?
When I was first married.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
It is. It's lovely.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
I am comfortable.
Annie!
Why?
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
I brought it to you in the hospital.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Mom?
I didn't know I had to.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Then why do you want to leave?
No, you just act like you do.
I think they call it a pasture.
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
That's not true.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Tom's gone.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Go ahead...
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
I should be in by two.
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
Doing what?
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
Why?!
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Everything all right.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You're allergic to hay.
I don't understa-
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
I was there for that shot, actually.
I'd love to go there one time...
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
We should be fine, then.
He thought it was a ghost.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
No!
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
I want to see Pilgrim.
We still have a way to go.
You ever miss it?
Sometimes.
Don't move!
Hack the Planet!
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Shh!
I want it.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
I'm gonna hit you!
Difficulty rating?
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Go fix the phones.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
I'm taking over a TV network.
And unpack.
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
Blow me.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Never heard of you. Done anything?
How did you know that?
Yeah! Sure.
Think you can do better?
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I'll hack the Gibson.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
You would have looked better.
Homicidal?
Gill.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Excuse me?
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
Nonono, thank YOU!
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Get up there Rachel!
Go!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
It's okay..it's okay.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
I'm not calling the fire department.
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Drive Carefully.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
No way. No how.
You bet.
In a second.
It was the nightmare man
No.
Why?
Don't you mean what you do best?
I don't want to look pushy.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Right here, Ben.
No problem, Sheriff.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
It isn't a man.
Evil.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Car trouble?
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
You blame everything on kids.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
He was watching me.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
No, he's not.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Yeah.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Michael's around someplace...
Will you call me tomorrow?
Lee Brackett.
He isn't a man.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
Have a good time.
Hi, Tommy.
See you.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
Tommy, let me in!
Was it the bogyman?
You're coming with us...
Of course not.
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
What does that mean?
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Well, let's hope so.
Oh.
Are you really interested?
Uh --
Oh, is that what it is?
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Right.
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Yes.
Yeah.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
Yeah?
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, God.
Well, sure.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Oh, right.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
I have been in love with you for so long.
What do you expect me to say?
I know it isn't.
I don't know.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Leave me alone, can you?!
You're not lost.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
It's on the table, Dad.
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Absolutely.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
They're in the basement.
Oh...
No--
Like what?!  What?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
You look so beautiful.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Oh, now-- 
I think so.
Thanks, thanks.
Well, then a third opinion.
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
...from Mavis, also.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
True.
Two thousand dollars.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Uh-oh.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Well, how about this?
Oooo.
You know.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Uh-huh.
Look, everything's going your way.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
You want some?
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
I remember you.
We didn't hit it off.
I'm fine.
...in a really horrible way.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Probably not.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
God.
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
...you don't have to think.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
I'm going to tell you later....
They're offering... 
I have not read you your rights.
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
Or, perhaps...
It's a growth business.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
Say it in English.
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
I'm not.
And who is "they?"
...the whole world's out to get you...
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
...would you excuse me...?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Impossible.
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....

....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
....what...? 
You seen John Brigham...?
Am I on that case, sir...? 
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
That could be.
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
How's your <u>child</u>?
A wonderful country...
I have had many excellent meals there.
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
I'll have them picked up.
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Where do you live?
No. 
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
What is that that smells so wonderful.
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....

It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
Or clear your windshield with it.
...but:  this particular statue...
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
...yes, yes, yes....
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...no...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
I don't understand.
I..
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..

No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
Like last night, Veronica?
You did last night.
All right.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Because you're an idiot.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Uh-huh.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Heather? Wha...
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Very very. The photographs?
Is she dead?
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Uh-huh.
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
Chick-en.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
Next channel, darling.
Yeah. Scary stuff.
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.

They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!

Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.

Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.

I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.

You're such an incredible woman.

You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.

Eighty third most common.
Yeah, how's that?

What's the difference?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.

How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.

I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.

Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
Well now there's a compliment.
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
Right.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
Were you in it?  In the war?
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
That's not what I mean...
Bodybuilding!
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
What about?
So this really does the trick, eh?
They're really white.
Let's watch some TV.
Well, it's for a woman.
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
I understand that.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Sure.
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Why are you mad at each other?
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
Stop knowing me so well.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
What?
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Fuck you, Philip.
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
There might be some extras in the garage.
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
Shut up.
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
And I can't help having a cold.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
I'd like you to see this.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
That is what bothers me.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Me?  Of course.
That doesn't matter.
Can you really tell from doing that?
How?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
I cannot explain.
What do you want?
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Then how did he know your name?
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
I know.
Yes -- it is.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
It will end tonight.
Conner?
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
And this?
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
I don't know.
It's not for me to decide.
Fine.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
It's happening right now.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
You can't run with suitcases.
Dennis.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
It won't be a problem.
You fucked up, Glen.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He said something about a girl --
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Just one question.  Please.
Another minute.  Please --
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Go, Chief.
Go, Chief.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Order your men to stand down.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Goddamned small town bullshit.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
What?
Not until the man calls.
They've been in there all day.
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Yes, sir.
No!  They're right here --
Yes.
What do you want?
You can let go.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Let me see your identity card.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
There is nothing to it.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Canadian Club?
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
The front gate would be best, General.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
I'll be over.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Why not? We are half way there already.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Thank God.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Just drive, Gregoire.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
What cards?
Move? Where to?
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
Of course.
Homework?
Please, be quiet.
We must do something.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
What about us?
But who is left?
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
Tell me what it was.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
He has taken the presidential suite.
The lieutenant wants the register.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
And what's Steven's status?
I'm moved beyond words.
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
-- fuck you!
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Poor Mr. Price --
And we get this money when?
Best of a nightmare.
Prove it.
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
I don't think so...
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
-- that's the fact, bud --
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Question answered.
No, no, it's just --
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
He would have been back by now.
Keep talking, I'll find you!
I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
Maybe it was Colleen...
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
My God, I heard something!
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
That's great, honey.
Daddy help!
Good night daddy.
To our family.
So what are you saying?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Know what?
We're not going.
I'm ok.
Maura.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
It was a shame.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
What!
How can I help you?
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Thank you.
And what would you do?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
What?
Well what is it!
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
I know what I saw.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
Then tell me what to do.
What is it?
Sorry.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
No.  Really?
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
It has already begun.
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
You sound disappointed.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Too-do-loo, babe.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
Prison?
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
Trust Leonardo....
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Baseball, why?
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
I guess that's a no.
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Yes.
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.
Alchemy.
If you think you're getting past me...
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Employer?  The president?
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
Sharp.
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Well, maybe I --
Adenoids?
Yeah.
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Why yes, do you know it?
...Why don't I just type this up...
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
...I'm sorry.
I know that, Amy.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
I'm sure you do.
Forty-eight years...
This I know, Benny.
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
I --
I --
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Well, I made the dean's list.
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Damnit, where's my car!
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
You don't believe in it?
Thank you.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
Mr. Holland?
It'll wait.
It's my day off.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
Wait. I want to listen.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
You can't really believe that.
Yes, thank you.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
You didn't drive her mad.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
Help me? How?
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
To the asylum?
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
So maybe you'll come too?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
So early?
Stuffed and baking.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
That one.
See for yourself.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Elena, what are you're talking about?
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
In the car.
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
Ben.
The phone's out.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Nah.
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
C'mon.
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
It was lovely!
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Well, we can talk about it.
You're not a psycho!
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
It'll warm you up.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
I gotta get to English class.
Am I right or am I right?
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Let's see!
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
What is it?
Thanks for the advice dad.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Yeah?
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
Sure.  Twinkie?
I dunno. I --
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Yeah.
Can I come?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
The ones you built?
I have to go to the bathroom.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
What's that, then?
Too bad...
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
We already did.
Worth pursuing?
I know.
Why?
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Where is he?
What I saw?
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
No.
What?
And something else that might interest you.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
How do you mean?
You know what about.
You know I remember that.
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
I'm always all business.
What is it?
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
Best friend?
That's what I said.
What was?
Who?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
No back-up.
Drop the gun, Walter.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Are you the leader of tis group?
Ah! You have questions?
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
I can't save her.
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
You let them do it.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
Does it?
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
What have you done?
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
He jests.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
Claudia - don't -
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
I can't. Go away from me.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
You are more beautiful than any of them.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
Be still!
Love?
You really believe that?
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Do you think so?
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
I can't.
I don't know any hell -
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
You finish her - if you feel so much -
Lestat, what do you mean?
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Yes.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
It's over, I'm telling you...
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Some.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
Come on, you can make it.
Why are you being like this?
Can't what?
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Who?
I told you.
I'm fine.
To get out of Southport?
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Did you get help?
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
I'll talk real slow.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
How's Julie?
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Must have missed the sign.
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly.
In case you do so, would you --
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Good winds and bad winds!
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Sleep well.
They shall not hurt you
You have forgotten my last name?
That should decide it or you --
It was, the plague
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Yes?
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Her name is Thea?
How did she die?
You are my friend.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
The General threatened me.
He hates all my race.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
Then foreclose!
What did . . .
Carter –– bank examiner.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Our clothes are dry.
No.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
No charge.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Nice girl, Mary.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Yes, sir.
Oh, George.
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
He's pretty young for that job.
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Very funny. Very funny.
Say, where's Mother?
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Huh?
It's important.
How do you do.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
I don't like coconuts.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
You may kiss my hand.
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Do you like it?
Well, then, sit down.
Mary . . .
Hi.
Yeah, just started.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Oh, shucks . . .
Hmm? Well, I . . .
You going to the lighthouse?
What the hell.  For you....
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Swim for it!
They're moving pretty fast.
We better go back in.
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
There's a shark....
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to swim home?
You bet.  Hang on....
The rope!  The rope!
Aren't you off-duty?
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Got it.
Okay, okay.
Yeah?
What else you got?
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
You don't make enough.
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Fooling around?
It's good with coffee.
In the den.
Terrific.
What'd I say?
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
What?
What for?
Shouldn't he be at home?
No.  Find your brother, okay?
That's you.
Maybe.
Just like this.
Mike?  Our Mike?
Figure they split?
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
Name it.
I love it.
Sean, baby, please....
He thought he had a good reason.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Make up your mind.
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Yes?
No.
... Me, too.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Me, too.
Sure.  Let's go.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
... He ought to put him in here.
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... Okay.
Who's going to do it?
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Make this quick!
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
We're taking that shark alive!
Afraid I can't do that.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
And big for his age.
Not good enough.
He's missing.
Someone's looking for you.
How you doing, Kelly?
Yeah, from Boston.
... Massachussettans aren't.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
No, think of something else.
It's okay, Sean.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Hey.
Calvin said it was all right.
Precisely.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
What the hell's there?
Five hundred yards.
No way.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
I want to see Kathryn.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
But you always let me....
No way....
It sure is....
We need beer....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
No....
It went away....
I don't know....
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
I like it.  Really....
I'd be afraid of losing....
It's beginning....
Whatever happens next.....
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
You check it....
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
It's too dangerous....
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
I'm still five....
I didn't.
You guys must be starving....
What?
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
Okay.
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
I'm not going to quit now....
Good.
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
It could have been an accident....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
Sure you can....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
It's wonderful....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
A big one....
You're not going to bet it all....
You'll be sorry.
That's hard to imagine....
The whole idea is preposterous....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
You're the man who drives the plane.
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
I made them, man....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Put me down, damnit....
Forget it....
They put bombs on dolphins....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
When we got the grant....
We got it together, Jake....
What?
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
How long has he been here...?
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Maybe it's gone....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
You don't like my voice...?
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
I told you....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Only me and Mom ..
I hope I'm not intruding?
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Maybe?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
Then give me that Zippo.
I was wrong.
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
Are you sure you didn't call?
I'm going up to the institute.
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
Bits.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
I don't see that at all ..
I thought it was Taylor's case?
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Wrong cabinet.
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Why not? You heard my voice?
No, it has a mind of its own.
Yes.
I don't know.
It was probably the wind.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
You should. It's wonderful.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
You said, you were in the bad lands?
How d'you know what I'm like?
Which is what?
I know.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I can't identify him ..
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Oh, tell the story.
No no. I knew.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Same to you.
Thanks.
Yeah, thanks.
We will be fine!
And I am...
Good night.
Right.  I'll come in.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
No--
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Very much.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Huh?
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Why not?
Uh, not today, but --
No, I'm saying to be --
Forget it.  Forget it.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
What's that supposed to mean?
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Go.  Flee.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
I'm not your brother!
Shut up!!!
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
What?
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
So do you.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
No, it's...
It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
Eric!
He's this way.
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
You couldn't have made that jump.
Here!
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
Where is it?
He loves you too.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Really?  What do you do there?
A well-accepted theory.
Which one do you prefer?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
It certainly does.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
John . . .
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
Everyone, keep your voices down!
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Where does it say that?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Possible.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Our chance to do what?
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Why did you come here?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
But why?
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
What?!
I believe in him.
Where's Ian?
Shhhhh!
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Oh my God.
They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
Look.
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
They smell.
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
Dilophosaurus.
I know.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
You can't hold it by yourself!
No, no, no!
Alan!
I don't know.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
Stick to my heels.
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Thank you.
Really?
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
That's a good idea.
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
You have no idea.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
The kids okay?
I know.
We gotta do something.
For today, I guarantee it.
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
All night.
It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
Please!
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
John, John.
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Excellent.
Why did you do this?
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Great.
You have a map.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
What about that other guy?
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
Who's chest?
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
So?
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Insomnolesence...
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
That doesn't make sense.
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
How's that possible?
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Up there.
Yes -- we do.
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
I don't know what you could have read.
Did you?
A man must eat --  And drink.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
Then its authority is in doubt.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
... My ... social situation?
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
I've never seen you here before.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
... All right.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
What of it?
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
You mean you've actually begun some?
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
Father ... Father!
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Value? ... Value?
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
What about him? Yes.
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
No.
So do I.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
My name's John Klute.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
OK.
I go on rounds.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
What do you think?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Arlyn Page.
No.
Don't touch anything.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
How do you know how bad it was?
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
No. I'm sore.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
Just send me a money order.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I wanted to give it to you first.
All right.
Goodbye, Pete.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Not particularly.
Playing.
In real life when does he hit you?
Show...
Wow!  French toast, really?
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Mom, I mean dad?
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
I guess...
That's okay.
I hate it.
No.
Dad?
Sure.
It's my name too.
You like it?
Uh, huh?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Where will my toys be?
Who will read me my stories?
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Sustained.
Six years.
Eight, almost nine years.
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
Yes.
No.
No.
Yes.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
What?
Fine.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Joanna, I don't give a--
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Yes, what?
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Kramer...
I don't believe you.
I'm going to take it.
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
No, but--
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
Look, Ted, all I--
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Got it.
I understand.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Three.  And add some basil.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Any day.
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Cow.
Here. We'll collect them.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
I am afraid.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
How many?
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
Answer. 
Roughly five thousand men.
Look here!
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
Ask whatever you will.
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
I had relinquished doubt.
The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
The people will not allow it.
I will not go.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
Good day.
Thank you.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
But you will always be here?
Does he have the spot?
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
I have smarter men.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
You cannot.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
Ahh.
I will miss you.
Too young?
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
Cocktail?
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
You're crawling around like a--
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Yup.
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
I don't know!
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
Right.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
You talk to Bickerman?
I never had sex with you!
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
I <u>told</u> you.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Who?
I'm sorry but you're...
Good.
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
You calm down!
Look.
Alright, Jack!
Good idea.
You wouldn't?
You wanna ride in my truck?
Let's go.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
So does he.
I'll take it!
Did he say anything?
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
I'm fine, thank you.
Seconds.  Three, four.
Yes.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
You threw it at me!!
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
Hector thinks you like him.
I guess.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
Wild guess.
Never cock. Just squeeze.
He's here, Ardelia.
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Starling -
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
That wasn't me.
Jack Gordon.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Did you ever work with her?
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
You're a tough one, aren't you?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I don't know. Is it?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Mmm. And what else...?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
Did he try to?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
All right, then tell me how -
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
You know I can't make that promise.
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
Did you breast-feed her?
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
We leave in the morning?!
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Miss.  May I?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
No. I will find you.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
Yes. Yes, I will.
It can be dangerous...
He delivered no such message.
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Ottawa!
: Only one or two loads.
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
What else?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Webb's at Edward?
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Atten-hut!
Gifts?
Wampum?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
This interview's over! The militia stays!
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Granted, Monsieur.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
What dead one on the ship?
No!
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
Where's Jones?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
What's your air reading?
Beautiful.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Russian.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
Let's hope it holds.
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
The air's stopped.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Your pocket?
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
It's hit us all hard!
I still will, if you don't mind.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Yes?
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
About twenty minutes.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
No.
Just give me the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
There is only three of us here.
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
. . . What?
I'11 meet you in the car.
A hundred grand.
For half a million?
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
You know it doesn't include the amp.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
Nick the Greek.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Twelve.
How the fuck should I know?
Leave your sister out of it.
So?
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Thank you, sir.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Yes, Sergeant.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
He swore by it.  What?
So is Buddy on your short list?
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
What?
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
They fought against the Indians?
That guy who got shot--
He's still pissed off about it.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
My father.
You lived in the States for a while?
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
If the next guy's a redneck.
That's right.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Why would you want to do that?
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
He was a unique individual.
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Seems like we have another one every week.
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
You go by your old house?
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
We have a murder?
Do you?
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Steve?
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
He was killed.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
What was your deal with him?
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Well, you were working there--
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
He hates me.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Yeah.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Couple months before I was born--
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
The shooter local?
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Another woman?
You know who it was?
Been away. Up to Houston.
He's gonna find out.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
Nix?
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
A Nix specialty?
Knew what?
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
It's him... it's him.
Yes.
You don't?
And you don't ask questions?
Does that mean...?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
When do you want me to start?
Do you?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
They won't tell you anything.
Why?  Because he had you?
You didn't marry him for love.
That's my business. Harry.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
It's okay.
You can't.
I think so.
Harry-?
No word from D'Amour?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
I heard he was the best.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Mine.
Probably.
Yes.  It's regrettable
What for?  You need to stay busy?
No.
Yes.
A Mister Quaid?
I won't say anything.
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
Will that do?  No?
Is that all?
Is that all?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Yes?
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
A couple of weeks.
Is he the Puritan?
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Not true.
Yes.
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Yeah.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
That lunch was the worst, huh.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Hi, Bob.
Thanks.
Oh?
Yes?
What?
Good...I'm tired.
Bye.
I don't know.
Are you sure you have to go?
It'll just be a few days.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Do you think they have a room here?
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
Bad?
When did they find her?
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
Must be a spare set.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
I hope so.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
I'm going to look around.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
That's true.
What are these?
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
You are the younger of two...
Get out of here.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
We millionaires yet?
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
How is he?
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
She's alright.
Camille, she'll be fine.
Are you okay?
But you use potato?
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You're a caterer?
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
Thanks.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Uh-huh.
Shh.  It's okay.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
It's okay.
Four days.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
He's in college?
Just like that?
I just can.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
He works at a bank.
For how long?
So that means I have to ride with you.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
God, here we go.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Yeah.
He ain't Spalding.
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
You do see me standing here, right?
I said fine.
What are we playing for?
Why not?
It happens, right...
What the hell's going on?
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Look, I'm entering the draft.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Thanks.
Getting there.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
Why do you keep asking me that?
What?
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
Then why are you so upset?
What?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
Business folks.
At one in the morning?
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
What are you doing in my room?
Okay.
I've been hearing you.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Said he'd be home later.
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
ooohhhhhh no.
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
Does this sound weird?
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
Bit messy.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
You won't.  You won't have to.
Well...is that illegal?
I'm sorry.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
What?
I've got troubles.
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
You mind if I come in, check things?
Claudia.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
It's ok, boy.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
What?
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Stay that way.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Braces.
Yes I do.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Where is he?
No.
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
I've seen it before.
There's no asshole like you.
Is Jack your son?
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
In aid of what?
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
-- fuck you.
Hollywood, mainly.
She's my mother.
From '84 to '89.
...this close...
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
Is Linda here?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
No one else in here?
Ok. What's your name?
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
No.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
No one else that I know?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
Did you ever touch her?
I really don't know.
I don't know what I've done.
You're her boyfriend?
I'II go....is it...back here?
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
No.
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
What are you doing?
....it's alright....
Hi.
mmmhmm.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
Yes. What? Yes.
That's pretty cool.
Maybe.
Yes.
This happens....this is something that happens.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
But -- what is he doing?
You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
To the Bastille.  And death.
Catacombs.  Very holy.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
What use am I?
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Who does?
Perhaps this will help.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
Raoul --
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
How did you know -- ?
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
Just... water.
Who came?
And you never knew why?
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
At least help Raoul.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Get out of my way.
They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
I must insist, Sire.
I am unhurt --
No, Keeper.
Eh?
... Two-thirty-seven.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
A letter.  May I see?
Raoul... is in love...
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
You set to go -
we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
I didn't hit shit!
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
And who are you?
She stole my car!!
I'll live...
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
Could explain why Fleming was there.
Figure you would have tried it already.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
No.  A witness.
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
No -
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
I'm not going anywhere!
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Could he handle a direct contact?
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
Not the Bible?
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
As long as they're dead...
You.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
No.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
'Changes?'
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
What's that?
He had to.
This is our boy...!
Stay in the trees.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
I have work to do at the plant.
I'm fine, Francis.
Francis? Where are you?
Are you okay...?
The Tooth...
No.
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
Yes.
No. I don't want to see you.
No.
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
No. I can help you.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
I call him a monster.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
We have it good, don't we?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Blue, then.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
You haven't smoked in two years.
No.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
You got a deal...
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Go on to the house...
Yeah...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
I got it. Thank you.
Stuart is fine.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
I thought you would have some ideas.
You're insane.
Yes.
No.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
Yes.
No.  Caspiar.
George, I hate sitcoms.
What's up?
But wasn't it funny?
What, you don't think I can beat him?
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
You've got good days and bad days.
Yeah...
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Andy!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
But it's only for thirty seconds!
Twenty!
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
No thanks.
I'm here, ain't I?
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Okay.  You're probably right.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
It is apparently not working.
Are you sure?
I'll take my chances!!
Er, yes.  Speaking.
They're gonna lynch him!
What's your name?
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
It's my name.
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
It's already begun.
And you are?
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
An accident?!
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
What happened to them?
I got you.
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Yes.
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
... Yes.
No.
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
What does that mean?
More important than what is when?
Wild, isn't it?
Your mind makes it real.
Yeah.
What do you believe in?
That's why we're here.
Yes I do.
Morpheus, I don't know --
Good.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
Honestly?  I don't know.
What?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Gee-zus.
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
... shit.
It's going into replication.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
Are you worried?
... right as rain.
We can't leave him!
There has to be something that we can do.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
Neo, this has to be done!
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Follow me.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Look fella...this is private...
You sure?
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Be careful.
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
Anybody wanna have a game?
'And with your spirit.'
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
'Thou art then a king?'
She don't look Jewish.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
Yeah.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
No, she isn't.
Didn't show up.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
Mind your own business.
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
Chinese food?
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Yes, you did.
What did he do?
Teresa.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
But...
Count it.
Sal!... fourteen street.
I know...I know.
You could say that.
You what?
Friends of yours Michael.
Quiet please.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
He's cute.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
He said he would be there with bells on.
But what?
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
You mean this, sir?
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
Right away.
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
Why yes, thank you.
Cold.
What an odd pairing.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
Did you just hear something?
Do you think I need a haircut?
That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
Me, too.
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
For how long?  And why?
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
Yours.
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Joe, you do get around.
Thanks, Quince.
Well, that's very interesting.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
'It's up to Joe'?
I from dat nex' place.
Make it go 'way.
Make it time.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
You loved back?
Rass!
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
As long as it takes.
You're welcome.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
You love Allison, don't you?
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
What do you mean 'free'?
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
I'm sorry.
Do you love Drew?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I don't have any.
Yes.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Yes.  I'm tired.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
It gets worse.
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Good night to you, Bill.
Good morning, Bill.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
That's what everybody says.
I understand.
No.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Of course.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
This part I'm interested in.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
'Fish'?
Then I can't help you.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
And we're very grateful.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
That's life.  What can I tell you?
Death!
You fill the bill, Bill.
I believe you did.
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
Yeah, I give a shit.
Yes, I believe I do.
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
You like him, don't you?
I am.  With you.
You mean like you loved Mom?
Uh oh --
What were you going to say?
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
I don't know.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
That's why it's okay.
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
I have no memory.
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
Then why is this my handwriting?
Interested in buying one?
Yeah, I remember you.
Take the money and walk away!
Yes.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Yes.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Don't remember.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
What happened?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
And what did he say?
Yeah?
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
Help me.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
What?
I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *
Did Teddy send you?
So why did you come here?
Then why are you here?
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
Fucking hope not.
Shut it, Teddy.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
It makes all the difference.					 *
Somehow, I'll know!
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
What's your twenty?
I was the kids' godfather.
They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Yes you do...
25% discount on the load.
Make it 35.
Right now.
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
And what is that?
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
No.
Cost less.  That's the point.
What do you mean?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Of course.
No.
I know.  And now?
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
And what do I do with him?
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
Something's wrong.
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
What kind of weight?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
Nothing.
We're makin' moves on each other.
Chill out Sonny.
As in...?
And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
What's your Miami PD badge number?
Okay.  What's up?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
To recruit you.
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
He did volunteer one time...
Yeah.
Yes.  What's up?
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
But what does your intuition tell you...?
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Define small.
"Future" of...?
I had to lay eyes on you.
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
You sure are a pretty lady.
Sure you're all right?
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
Don't say nothing about you either.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
What of?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
They gotta be.
Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Yessir, I can see that.
Uh, yessir.
Instant V-goddam-D.
No. You got it.
... and taxi fare for me.
Getchmis...?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
Nah, just covered with batshit!
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
Stop shitting me, man!
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
The Hilton.
Oh Jesus! 
Sure.
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
But just...
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
Twelve years.
That doesn't seem so bad.
What's that?
After we're outside the kogus?
I know where it is.
Yeah? Where?
Max - where?
Maybe he's changing jobs.
You can't take anything seriously.
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
That's a great philosophy.
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
No, you talkin' at me.
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Oh, Jesus!!
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
Depends.  You got a memo?
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Nino, please...
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Don't get kinky here...
Susan, we're not b-
No.
What-
Peter-
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
Ah...
Gross. What is it?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
Just like Trump Tower, then.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Sure.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
What are they...?
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
Misery?
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Well, I hope you like it.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
What?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
It is.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
It will.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
I'm sure you're right.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
No, the typing kind.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
That'd be a first.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
From her point of view or mine?
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
I suppose I did.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
It's that time.  Go.
Ninety-three point four million.
I hope there's a place to land.
And the check's in the mall.
No.  Should I?
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
At least you walked.
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Damn, you're beautiful.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
Affirmative.
Oh Ethan!..
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
You mean it'll be difficult.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Yes, I gathered as much.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
I'm fine..
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Yep.
She must still be on the property.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
By asking me.
You're right, of course.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
So what do you suggest?
What about him...?
I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
All ten million.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
What happened to Jim?
What happened to Jim?
Who is "they?"
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
One hour.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
The arms dealer.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
We'll see.
Jack.
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Just don't chew it.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Yeah.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
Keep counting Claire.
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
Jack you're so wicked.
Twenty minutes.
Itís not working.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
What?
I'm going to bed now.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
I won't come.
I didn't give you away the first time.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
What are you doing here?
And what did they say?
You have too many dogs.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
I'm going to marry him.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Stupid.
Seven years ago.
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
A wolf without a foot!
Me neither.
Get all of me. Take everything.
That light.
I've never seen a moon like that.
She didn't like me.
Oh no I didn't!
I can't do that!
I can't!
But he wants me to come!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
It's the best thing there is.
He didn't come!
I was.
No.
Is Johnny here?
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Never is a long time.
I shouldn't.
Yes?
I don't understand.
This is a good suit.
Alright.
Who is he?
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
We should talk alone.
No.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
She recovered.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
That's incredible.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Johnny...
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
It was a miracle!
She was just too young for you.
None of your business.
Don't shit where you eat.
Oh.
Is who down there?
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
...What?
Through ... We found them.
What do you mean?
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
I'm not interested.
The Britons.
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
Who are they?
NI!   NI!
We want ... a shrubbery!
Oh, please!
You said it again!
Come on then.
You'll what ... ?
You're a looney.
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
What does it say?
It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.  Now the rest of you stand |      well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              HECTOR |      Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              ROBIN |      Look out. | |  The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them.

Quite.
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
I'm thirty-seven.
Well ... I AM king.
Come on, patsy.
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
... Well, we did do the nose.
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
Do me a favour.
When's your next round?
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
Is it?
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
What - the curtains?
But, Mother ...
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
I was saved at the last minute.
No, not anyone else - just me.
What is your name, handsome knight?
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
No, I'm not.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
I can't move to tidy.
Louder, girl!
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Of course.
I see.
Quite.
It's so infernally cold in here.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
It is quite late enough.
That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I am a blank sheet.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
I'm not married.
I wouldn't know.
Aye.
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
In time, she will.
She's well, too.
I'm glad of it.
Archie.
Aye, ma'am.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
I heard something.
Yes, ma'am.
I do not accept.
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
No, ma'am.
So?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Not too protracted, I hope.
No, indeed.
Whom?
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
A few days, ma'am.
No.  I shall be out walking.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
Sure.
Yeah...
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
Funny.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
Sure.
What?!
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
No I'm not...
Dante's Inferno.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
Put in a quarter.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
Right, then...
Yeah, that's what worries me.
Check your read-out.
Never been on a snowboard.
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
I'm okay.
In this world, wrong is right!
Oh God...oh god...
Not yet, honey...
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
The game will guide you.
Can you say anything but "cool"?
I'm going home.
I'm going home Cynthia.
You're broke!
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
I agree with what you said...truly.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
One.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
No. I can't.
What do you mean?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
Unh, unh.
Mulholland Drive?
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
Good luck!
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Where at?
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I'm working on it.
Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
Excuse me ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Hey , Hey !
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
I am thirty two.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
How can this happen ?
Yes.
Thanks.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Wake up, we're in trouble.
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Which one, this door is locked !
Shut up ! It's me.
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Come to the rescue again I see.
No.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Thanks, I needed that.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
No.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
You're being narrow-minded.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
My mother.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
I won't.
You're so clever.
TAXI!!!
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
WHAT??
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
What if you don't wanna be found?
You would.
May I use the phone please.
And I thought I was weird.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
In the tar??
Owh...
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
What do you think?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
Like what?
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Ten bucks.
For the mini-bike fund.
Was Rose.
Rose this not the place to be having this...
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Bye.
Oh...what's that?
There's plenty of fruit.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Is that a yes?
Not exactly.
Nothing, nothing at all.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
I'll be here.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
I know, look at his little hands.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
WHAT?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Yes they are.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
I wrote that.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
It's no big deal.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Oh, how do you mean?
Are you mad at me?
Did she ever see Vada?
In ages, I know, me neither.
I'll second that.
Pointing upwards Look...
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Any more soda left?
Why?
Soon honey, soon.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
Hi.
Get away, get away!!
No, no.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Thank you. Bye.
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
For this class?
I wrote a poem too.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
Can we look around in your camper?
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Thomas?
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Hi.
Yes!!
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
Goodnight.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
No.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
I stopped that!
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
I wanna live with them too.
Really?
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
He likes her better than me.
Then go home, baby.
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
It is not.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let's spit on it.
Something like that.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
Go figure you.
I wish.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Oh, you're more than okay.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
A trademark move, don't touch it.
No.
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
... whatever is manly and independent.
Only.  If he wants to.
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
... unless he has a hump.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
It doesn't say th...
Nobody has.  So far.
Such as.
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Never can tell.
It's more than that.
Me either.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
The night we met.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
... maybe it's congratulations.
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
Shhh.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
What is that sup...
Well, if that's the way you f...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
An so it is.
Right here.
Hi! Star.
Is there food?
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Bye, Bye.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
He knows better.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Whose?
Minimum.
Stop it!
When is it?
To the bathroom.
How in the world did he get shot?
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
I'm not really a musician.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Do you carry door handles?
Nash.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Does their hair fall out?
Bye.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Yes, it is --
It just is.
Hi.
Wow!
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
I have to go.
Oh.
Fifteen minutes?
Yea.
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
Money's no object.
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
You do?
Where are you from?
Who?
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
I'll be dammed.
Yes, they were.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Susanville, Soledade.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
I can appreciate that.
Lobotomy Bay?
Ain't love grand.
Ready.
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
She doesn't talk?
Let's do it.
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
When have they ever been right?
Sure.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
You made every day like kindergarten.
Just for fun, I guess.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
I hear ya. Play.
How 'bout Mallory?
Okay.
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
Why?
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Is that her real name?
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
No thanks.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
You think so, Frankie?
That's right.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Well, what d'you know?!
I been sendin' her money.
Okay.
Guess I don't.
Where was your father born?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Okay, thanks very much.
Oh yeah? That's good.
You must be new in town.
No. I'm new in town.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
How d'you mean?
No thanks.
What is it?
That's right.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
You almost got into trouble back there.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
What d'you mean?
I didn't know you had one.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
We'll be all right.
Yeah.
They won't.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Duff--
Like what?
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
'Got a good thing, man.
'Bye, Jocko.
That's right.
No, thanks.
Okay.
She'll do.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Hell, I'm just like him.
How are you?
Guess it's never been easy.
I doubt it.
I guess not.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Hi.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Okay, boy, beat it.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Omar, listen to me--
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
How's the villa's security?
What does this have to do with me?
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
You son of a bitch...
It hasn't yet.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Prepping your trip.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
What?
Nobody has.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
We got problems topside.
We run. You crack the pattern?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
Case.
I thought you already left.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
What's my end?
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
Too late?
Won't that mean you're dead?
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
What is it?
You're out of time, man.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Shut up.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
Yeah, I know.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Leave.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy—  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
That is lingerie.
Very romantic.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
But I don't want it straightened out.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Kristen got a quote?
They hid my car--
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
But I'm not a penguin.
See!
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
I-
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Thanks. So do you.
You were attracted to me?
We're very evolved.
Who are you guys?
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Maybe we should sit.
We went through the door...
Everybody knows about--
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
I can't help it.
Good.  I'm hungry.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
No.
He stayed a long time.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
Specifically.
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
Just out for a while.
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
What the hell are you talking about?
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
I'm sorry...
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
I know.
Wow...
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Who?
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
What do you mean?
C'mon, cut it out.
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
Ghostbusters are fearless.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
Hi.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
Mom?
I had such an awful dream.
No, she's right.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
He's real.
How do we find him, Kristen?
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
Why is that?
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
What's that supposed to mean?
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Didn't get much sleep.
All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
Never been here before?
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
And what are they?
No.  We're alone.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
I won't allow it.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
No.
Really, no.
No.
I forgot my bag.
Thanks.  Well...
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Hello.
And what happens next in the dream?
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
That's fine.
I thought you were leaving.
Let's go in.
What did you say?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
Yes.  Always have had.
Okay.
Stay forever.
Don't ask.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Hello.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
What's the thing?
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Nice surprise.
I haven't decided.
Yes.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Miracles do happen.
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
... get fired.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Right. 
Yes -- sort of...
Working with Leonardo.
Di Caprio.
Well, yes.  Groovy.
It was good.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
This is Henry James film?
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Can I help you?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
No -- did you?
Is it someone we know?
I believe I have.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
And she's in your house.
No -- you're right.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Yes, that is correct.
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Mister Sefelt?
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Who? Tell me!
Mister McMurphy!
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
No way.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Go ahead! Go back!
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
Ca-na-da...
Yeah...
Are they all crazies?
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Atta boy, Cheswick!
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Where ya goin', Mac?
Yeah!
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
Shhh...
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
What for?
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
Just warmin' up.
That's nice. Send me a post card.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I don't trust you!
No!
What's he talkin' about?
Yeah, Mac?
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
Me, too! Me, too!
No.
What is it?
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Time out!
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
'Kay, Mac!
Are you a doctor?
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
'Kay...
You's better believe it, brother!
Okay. How you doing?
To help you relax... please...
You an' me, Chief.
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
On what?
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
I don't have any.
I'm sure you will.
After you, ma'am.
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
Is he one of the loonies?
He's dead.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Buona notte.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
No.
Your hair... is perfect.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
You're sure...
No...
Non.  Please.
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Well, good.  Good for you.
I don't know if that's such a--
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Well.  Congratulations.
In that case... no...
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
What?
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
There is no us.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Really?
Oh, hello.
What?
No.  He smokes.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
So, what's your point?
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
Is he married?
I know...  It was.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
I know.  You're right.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
No...  I can just tell.
It's a coincidence.
You don't have a passport.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Does Dwayne know about this?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
He fell out.
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
What'd you find?
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
What if he doesn't like me?
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
I thank you.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
Giovanni.
You miss me?...
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Good strategy.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
Why should he forget it?
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
In a minute.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
Which side are you with?
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
How would you've done it?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
I am?
How do you like it?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
What for?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
I just told the Father.
Edie— it's—
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
I don't want to hear it in there.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—  — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
Good luck.
You go to—
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
What?
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
I'm just resting my feet.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Yeah?
Sure... .
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
I told you lay off.
Looking for me?
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
Take it easy now, Terry.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
Nothing happened, Johnny.
You want to know somethin'—?
You ratted on us, Terry.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Okay.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
Nothing is worth your life.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
Of course I do.
A situation easily remedied.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
I will decide the conclusion.
Then cancel my order.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
You mean...!
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
I'm so frightened.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
Aannnnaahhnn.
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
What?!
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
I know a Glenn.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
He'd call every once in a while.
Really.  Hm.
Who are you?
Yes.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
He ain't the problem, Jack.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
I'm a tourist.
Sure looks that way.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
Two hours.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
I saw Karen Sisco.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
Whatta you wanna do?
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
And what happened to Carl?
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Wait.  You not Adele?
Excuse me, Adele?
How are you, Raymond?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Wait, I know him --okay?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Who was it answered the phone?
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
What, as a sales rep?
I don't have a problem with it.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
It would be worth the risk.
So do you.
That's not what you were about to say.
Why are you mad?
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
In the trunk?
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
What's to think about?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
Islamic.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
Really?
Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
What-- when?
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Oh, he's moved out?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
Off a tip?
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
It's possible.  Why?
I told you, he isn't here.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Likewise.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Ten gees.
He was that good?
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Where's that lizard?
You guys are new?
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
So what are you saying?
Come on!
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Y-Yes Sir.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
How did you?...
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
Have the planes made it to China?
All of 'em.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
Crank her!
Peggy Sue!
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
I'm not telling.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Were taking you back to the nurse.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
That loud—mouthed little bitch~
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Don't say that...
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Is this slow enough for you?
I have to talk to you..
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
How'd you know about that?
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
It opens, too. Look inside.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I'm trying.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I'll just set it right here.
I'll never give up.
Touchy, touchy!
What, why?
It must run in the family.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
Don't you get along with your parents?
I'd love to.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
What?
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
How do you feel?
Oh. I forgot.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
I don't feel very festive.
Way to go, Mom!
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Rosalie Testa!
You have an incredible memory.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Wbat're you talking about?
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
High tech. I like the sound of that.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
Pretty much so.
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
It sucked.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
All set.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
He pissed me off.
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Go later...
All the time.
You know everything, don't you?
Sorry...
K-R-O-one.
Andy?
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I said, don't worry about it.
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
Ready for what, baby?
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Continue.
They sabotaged me.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Thank you.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Thank you.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
Uh huh...
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Want to hear my favorite aria?
I still am.
No. I didn't.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Really?
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
Why are we going to do that?
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
That's correct.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Second.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Who?
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Helloooo...
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
Jesus.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
Look deeper.
Think about what?
One or two.
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
Like the light is scalding it.
Not sure. Ten?
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
How many?
Let's wait on the power cells.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
For your own fear.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
I'm born-again.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Not staying in here another....
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Say that again.
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
So which one caught your eye?
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
What, it's broken?
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Do you have any weapons?
Just the same, I want one.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
The evidence was very meager --
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Yo!
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Sustained.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Show this to the President.
Huh?
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Climb off me, will you!
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
But I'm not prepared to die.
Okay.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
I'm for that.
Yes, I can do that.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
The Hunt Club.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
What about it?
I don't know.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
Okay.Up to the cave.
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Yes.
Maybe not.
Taylor, you can't.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Shaddup bitch.
What?
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
Out there man - behind the log.
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
I volunteered.
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
How far does this train go?
Well..
I don't know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
Why certainly, baby.
Possibly, Miss.
Bank?
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
No thank you.
Sure... but somebody always does..
Is this the best you can do?
They know you here--know your name.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Couldn't be.
You don't know who he is?
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
Killaine...
Killaine's wise to what?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Including Killaine.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Magruder does.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Ale. I don't mind.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
We wouldn't have met at all.
Is it a crime?
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
Points very straight to her.
Goodbye, Betty.
We know everything.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
You mentioned information.
Why not here?
I've got good ears.
You're not English.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
I wouldn't know.
A couple of hours.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
That's not enough.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Go live in a tent.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Such as?
Pretty big chance, huh?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
Warm water, no doubt.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
Aye.  You have a point there.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Why should I mind?
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
You already have the checks, darling.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
I say YES!
I think you'll do very well.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
I see.
Thank you.
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
I have to be up early. 
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
I haven't really thought about it.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
Oh yes.
Let me see.
Mmm...
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
I'm not sure.
Yes, finally.
Are you up to something?
Hello.
What about the Cromwells?
Next time tell her I've gone away.
Dad.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
Yes, you said.
Yes.
Now listen...
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Once.
You first!
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
There's nobody else here...
Yes, sir.
I take the skin off chicken.
Not so far.
Babes.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Caught my first tube this morning.
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
They took a left at the next light!
Shrimp and fries.
I'm serious.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
People are expendable to Bodhi.
What?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
They're getting better equipped every day.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
What, Sergeant?
I'll take him.
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
Hawkins?
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
What?
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
What motel you staying at?
It pays.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
I never joke about money.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
What?
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Off the boulevard.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Mmm, I could tell.
"Occupational hazard".
No shit.  They expensive?
I sell them.
What are assets?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Of course.  How much?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
All right, two thousand.
You're forgiven.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
Shall we mingle?
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Ready to stomp sod?
Vivian, what the --
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Shush.  Of course you can.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
My what?
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
But, Edward...
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Let him answer.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Was that you?
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Rent.  You're late.
Okay.
And who is that?
Vivian.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Will I like it?
But I always eat like this.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I don't think it would fit you.
Then why bother curing me?
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
As you wish.
Well ... you were dead.
What? -- go on --
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
Veer left. Left. Left!
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
He's really very short on charm.
Yes, some of the time. 
If there are, we'll all be dead.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
What?
What is it?
Yeah. It's really good.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
Okay.
As you wish...
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Light him.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
Tell me.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
For the Princess?
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
"I want to croon,
"Keep a shining in...
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
I have hurt your feelings.
It's nothing ... nothing.
Mr. Bialystock ...
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
What???
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Very nice girl.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Oh, the best one.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
I shall count the minutes.
Hindenburg...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
What have you done, LSD?
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
No.
I'm not the police.
What?
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
Back where?
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
Can I trade in my car and take another?
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
Five hundred.
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
Like what?
Just what he told your detective.
May I talk to you?
Lila.
I want to know if my sister is here.
With you.
Huh?
I hate tears. 
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Just wait here?
Sam.
Does that mean we can't...
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Why not?
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
Sam, let's go get married.
Los Angeles.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
Uncommon, too.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
To a private island, like you?
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Haven't any.
Yes.
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
What--special autopsy?
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Well, news of Buckley?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
How? What can I do?
The wound is bleeding!
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
The body of Joan Gale!
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Nope, I'm through!
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Now don't that call for an extra!
I used to be married to one.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
It's all yours.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
You go in for dangerous things.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
That is unfortunate.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
You did.
I could go out of town.
It's an experiment.
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
So I can move on.  You too.
Where is she?
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
They were just bad men, that's all.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
What is it, Rose?
You were pretty bad, huh?
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
Yeah, I'd believe it.
All right, what do you know?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Well, yeah.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
But how would you find him?
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Yeah.
Boy! Wow!
What are they doing, Doll?
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Oh. Did you say something?
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
What time is it?
No reason at all, darlin'.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
What did you forget?
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Over... my... dead... body!
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Fine.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
No, sir.
There are more on the other side.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Yeah, I remember it.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
She looks terrible, just awful.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Gonorrhea?
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Be quiet, Rose.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
It'll get better now.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
What and?  That's what I got.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
I don't know.  Fuck off!
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
That wasn't my fault.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Yeah.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
What?
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
They shot us all, kid.
It's not gonna happen.
Bullshit.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Let's hope.
No you're not.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Dead.
Just got here.
Your wish is my command.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
Beholden to none.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
They're... around.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
Fine. Together again, huh?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Leia!
I don't know.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
You, too.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Certainly not!
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
It's alright Janet.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
I didn't make him for you
Goodbye
You're too kind.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
...Fine.
...I'm sorry.
...I don't know.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
It's not that --
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
Could ya take off that hat.
Don't want weak legs.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
...Yes --
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Don't say that.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
It's not your house --
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
No wine.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
I agree.
What's happenin' here?
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
...Fine.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
No -- Just me.
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
Hey --
Maybe I like garbage.
What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
...Tomato?
Spider Rice.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Message -- What message?
Yeah.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
I got pain an' experience too.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Damn! How's it look?
See what?
Great, kid, great.
'Bout what?
He ain't losin' nothin'.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
...People talk to me more.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
So where is it then?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
Check the scrawl.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
No...
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Eddie, come on.
That's what you woke me up for?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
As soon as is humanly possible.
That was the idea.
No, I don't.
Take it easy.
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Yeah?
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
From this box here...
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
The what?
Am I like Such a fellow?
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Art thou hurt?
Young Romeo is it?
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Romeo, come forth.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Well what shall I swear by?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
I am for you.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Leaving...
And I don't believe you...
I'm up for that...
How do we know that?
That's why you were riding with him.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
I thought I did.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
That's him.
You lose them!
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
There's a problem...
Not so fast.  Who's that?
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
That's it.
Not exactly.
How did you know?
I didn't expect that he would.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
You seem one to me.
Eat shit and die slowly...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
No thanks.
I do.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
Because that's what I would have done...
Gregor's cell phone...
You were smoking?
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
A lot of people died.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
You don't have to do this.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
It's my job.
Very ugly.
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
I'll work on it...
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
You sure?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
I'm alright.  And you?
The Russian would be easier.
I get the picture.
I can't get enough of it.
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
I hear you.
Cash and what?
Never heard of it.
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
At the expense of six people.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
That's not what I mean.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
What are you thinking?
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
Then we're screwed.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Uh huh.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
Nothing.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
Could it have been this?
Yeah.
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
This just might be our ticket!
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
We appreciate that.
Maybe I should come along.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Well I just uh, you know...
Yeah I'd say C...C.
No I don't.  You sure you haven’t seen her?
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
What?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Dwayne -
Then what the hell are you all about?
We're gonna talk.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
And what happened?
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Give me the bad news.
We're going to find out.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
No, sir.
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
I'd like to see you try.
Is this about the funny money?
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
That's right.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Try to land on your feet.
I'm sorry.
This won't take long.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
This is a very dangerous man.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
And you ain't black!
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
Good at what?
Ask me if I give a shit.
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
IT IS CRAZY!
What?
I cannot go to LA...
You pull a muscle or something?
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
What did you say?
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
What?
It's your turn!
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
She never even looked at you.
No.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Dancing?
MMMMMM!!!!
It's worth it to me.
The Plaza Hotel?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Fine with me.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
Just trying to make it look real.
Baby Duck?
I'll take him.
Don't.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
This is still Hong Kong.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Carter.
This is pathetic.
Tell me about it.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
What plate?
No.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Stool pigeon.
Come on!
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Good God, ya'll!
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
It's him.
Oh yes.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
What?
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Nobody touches me.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
She's fine.
Han?
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
Thank you.
God bless you, Maggie.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
"Never say die."
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
You afraid to try?
You don't know.
Of course.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Yes.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
Me?
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
She's the boss.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
I'm just finishing up, too.
Good boy, Port Hole.
It sounds nice.
I love you.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Walter, I'd love to --
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
No.
It was my mother's.
-- it was a betrayal.
So what happened?
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
I think that's what I'm saying.
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
I know.
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
We'll move them --
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
Mom, we already...
Sure you do --
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
It's hard to imagine.
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
Why not?
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
What is it?
My feelings exactly.
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
I know.
What was?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Is that what she used to sing?
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Oh, right.
She's going to cook something for us?
Okay.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
I just called for a second.
Was Mom an adjustment?
This is the one I like.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Shut up.
This conversation is finished.
Hi.  Sam?
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
What do you mean?
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
You look good yourself.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
Yeah.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
An American.
Yes. We will light the candles.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
Never... never... never!
I'm a fool.
Antonio paid for it.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
But honey ...
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
The what!
You've got to help around the house!
You should have helped her without being asked.
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
Yeah.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
Not even a guess?
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Colette ...
Don't worry. He's out of town.
Trust me. We're safe.
Find a new job.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
I don't want to leave you.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
I know a guy.
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
No. I'm good.
Sure, Jimmy.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Hey, check it out...
Crank or glass?
Make me an offer.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Pull your pants down.
Big Bill.
What?!
Okay! Okay!
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
Question is, what are you doing here?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
Again, I thank you.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
What is it, drugs?
Don't worry about it.
I thought you were done.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
Where are your men now?
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
No kidding.
You must be a hell a shot.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Like hell, you did.
I'd love to hear it.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
Gives Wade the second shot.
To each, his own.
A half-track, anything.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I don't expect to live that long.
Did he see any sign of them?
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
Same place we are.
You don't count.
Sure, you got one?
But, sir...
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
What about Talbot?
Since when have things been normal?
Nope.
How about I go right, sir?
How about you shut up and take your position?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Let's just find someplace.
Yeah.
Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Sure, Reiben.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Ours is not to reason why.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Why's that?
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Yes, sir.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Yeah?
And Sarge?
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
We know.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
What about you, Captain?
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
He's a mess!
C'mon Lloyd.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
I can accept that.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Oh yeah!
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Okay, I give up.
I'm fine.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Yeah?
Yeah.  What a day.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Pardon me?
Eight.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Job?  Being a great date.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
You think so?
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Come on.
Friends with potential.
Yeah?
Am I wrecking my car?
Yeah.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Your letter came yesterday.
How can I look at you and say this?
You need to study?
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Very talented.
I know this part, keep reading.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
Your car?
No way.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
What?
I called her up.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
You know Diane Court?
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
War.
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
It's up to you.
In Breslau.
Good.
You're kidding.
Yeah, what's that?
I don't know.  Soon.
It's good business.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
Look it up.
Yeah, I can.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
That's great, thanks.
I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
I need a drink.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
The war could end.
Do what?
Christmas presents.
Oskar -
Are you losing money?
And killing.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Yes.
Stern.
Would it do any good?
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
That doesn't work, sir.
On national television.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
What is it?
Stop it...
What? I can't hear you...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Who is this?
That's okay.
That's too bad.
Don't forget to set the alarm.
What?
Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
You’re all in this together?
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
Finish what my son started.
Good question. You took the bait.
You’re not going to get away with this.
I really don’t like that comparison, honey.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Hope you’re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
I know that.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Can we turn the light on?
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Don't worry...
What if your life depended on it?
Stay away from the cop.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Watch your back.
Are you in danger now?
Don't do this.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
I counted four.
Her old boyfriend?
You're not allowed to ask that.
..harmonica style is okay.
Gale?
But she's standing right next to you.
I get scared really easy, okay.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Don't panic.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Hello.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
To me Hollywood is about death.
What did you know about your mother?
Catch him, or kill him.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
What Rielly?
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Sid I can see you!
They've got her!
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Just Jennifer.  And you.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
What the hell are you doing?
Need to get in that building?
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
They're the ones who approved it.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Yeah.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Who is this?
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Oh yeah.
Yeah...
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
You have to move on, Sid.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Fuck you.
Stop it!
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
I want to talk to you for a second.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
What's that noise?
Do you like scary movies?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Don't...
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
I believe you...
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Guess.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Then what are you doing here?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Sidney's father?
I'll get my camera.
...yeah...
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Yeah.
Afraid not.
How is she?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
I told you to send it back.
Call the police.
You want to go live?
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Ricki Lake.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
So who are you?
Uh-huh.
...out at the airport...
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Working, thank you.
She's the Scream Queen.
You got it.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
I can cry on cue.
No, Sid.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
I'm not worried.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
He was there, Tatum.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
I bet he's pissed.
And you believe it?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
Deal.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I did. He's full of shit.
For once, Stu, drop it.
Tits -- see.
I'm in.
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
What the fuck is going on here?!
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
No one yet.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
Can we talk about this in private?
Tonight.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
A switchblade.
Bear with me.
Just wait!
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Yes we do.  Here...
Let's go.
Him?
What?  Assessing fines?
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
I don't.  Neither do you.
It's not what you think it is.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
No point in arguing anymore...
We had him.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
You do your job...
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
Big surprise.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
Don't do this... please...
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Crime of passion.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
Why don't you finish the job?
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
How far's the river from here, Mose?
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
How many, would you say?
Now mount up, son...
JOINT action?
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Scar?
Cut it out, will ya...
Look?
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
Nine...  Ten!
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Only if I'm dead!
We got two around that age...
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Come on, say it.  You know...
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
It still worked in town.
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
So do I, believe me.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
Hi, darling.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
Does this dog here belong to you?
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Just call me Elisabeth.
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
We should leave the past alone.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Right you are, governor!
Really?
Lady?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
Done.
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
It is all locked safe in here
As soon as I have found my muse
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Who wrote that?
Fifty pounds? What for?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
To my weekly confession.
I did not.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
I don't know, it's a mystery.
How goes it, Will?
Burbage says you have a play.
Good title.
The daughter of his enemy.
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
Be still.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Oh, but they can!
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
I like her.
But the plague
A lowly player.
Oh, not for the world!
Can you love a player?
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Oh
Mr. Henslowe?
Yes, some of it is speakable.
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
I was the more deceived.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
But why me?
Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
I am going to church.
My hat?
I . . .
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
A theatre poet?
He couldn't get his car started.
I don't hear this.
Is this necessary?
I don't know.
Security.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
What's wrong?
Looking for you? Yes.
We just wanted to speak to you.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
About the mail --
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
But there's no --
What?
Yes.
Well, yes.
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
For the flat.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
So I gathered.
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
OK.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
Who?
No, I don't.
David?
Forget it.
Where he can't get it?
Everything.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
We were just sorting things out.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
What?
You mean I can have the room?
Yeah.
Of course.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
No.
I should hope so.
And you need your sleep.
Exactly what I was --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
I'd be delighted.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
And that's not the same thing?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Maybe... why do you ask?
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
What?
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Well she...
She's a friend of Jill's.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
... what?...
No.
It isn't?
I guess so.
Okay.
Hello.
No thanks.
No thanks.
... yeah.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Am I what?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You think that's funny, don't you?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Yeah.
Well, yeah... you know.
I guess not...
Yeah.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
You going to tell him?
No, thanks.
Great.
Yeah... I mean great.
Why not?
I just have to do one little thing.
I won't screw you up.
What?
You did, I know you did.
What about it?
-- we can't now.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
-- oh I thought you were --
-- do you want ice?
-- you've got to leave.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
Otis is dead.
What's gonna happen?
I am?
Yeah, baby.
-- Sure.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Okay...  Night, baby.
What!
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
Your advice!
When I get off work.
Where's your car?
Ha, ha.
Commercials.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Did you?
Did you?
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
I see.
Thank you.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
I know what you mean.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Well... who are those guys?
Well, what?
Wasn't sure it was you.
I'll call you back.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
You do?
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Jackie, what're you doing?
I know, I'm sorry.
Nothing.
Well, it's George.
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
-- sort of a boyfriend?
He's a hairdresser.
-- oh I don't know --
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
What was the Donner party?
No, Dad.
I'm not supposed to.
Tony.
How does he tell you things?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Okay.  You behave yourself.
All right.
Okay...oh!
Yeah.
No.
Where does he go?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Advocaat is it?
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
And, er... where are they now?
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Sure.
Good.
What line of work are you in now?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
No, nothing at all.
Yes, I did.
Yes.
I can't really remember.
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Give me the bat.
Go away from me.
Go away.
Wendy...
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
Not for me.
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Hi.
Fine.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Blue. This blue.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
Where's Mom?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
What?
Rats...
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
What?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Sure.
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
You want to know what I think?
There! You see!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
But Uncle Al! You said-
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
Perhaps.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
Yes, Mary?
Were you tempted?
And you listen to that?
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
You can handle this.
What did who say?
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Good evening, Vincent.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
Yes, Betty?
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
Not in years.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
That man -- who is he?
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
I knew that.
Five a.m.?
I... I brought you something.
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
What?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Keep moving!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
Bless you.
Don't you know it!
Very well.
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Are you talking about me?
What's a concubine?
Like to who?
A what?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
You have a phone call.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Maybe Hawaii.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
I've been worried about you.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Even nuns have to pee.
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
You won't even tell us?
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
We didn't tell you what?
Take care of it.
Not... totally.
Yeah...
It didn't work, Vince.
So, take it off.
Maybe pants.
Which one?
She's praying.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
She wasn't a nun?
She's our inspiration!
But how do we get there?
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Yes?
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
How did you hear this?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Two days... ?  For murder?
What is that?
What are you spying on?
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
What?
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
They need guidance.
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Not for lack of trying.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
What happened?
We should go.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
I doubt that's the end.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
Yes, he does.  May I try?
I insist that you have it.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
It was not butchery.
Just... keep where you are.
The skull is gone.
Come with me.
It was you there?
What did he say, Katrina?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
He moves too fast.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
I... I can't do this.
Yes, actually.
What did you say?
You are from the Hollow?
The Horseman.  Yes.
Doctor, he is awake.
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
I like them french-fried potaters.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Can I see him?
What you got that's good to eat?
Karl's my name.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
What do you want, hun?
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
I hate you!
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
Childers.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
I did live there in the state hospital.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
Yeah, I did.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Naw.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
He ain't no count.
I don't reckon I know.
Yeah.
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
I reckon.
Is that right?
You will? For sure?
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
I ain't got no boy.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
Yes sir.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
I didn't aim to.
I'll be dog.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
What's that you say?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
I know.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
Ready. Any time you are.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I mean, it's a good story.
Eighteen and a half years.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
You don't give up, do you?
And what's that supposed to mean?
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Bully for you.
Five thousand bucks.
It's all yours, baby.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
What difference does it make?
The refrigerator?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
I shouldn't have let him go.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
Jesus.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Not a one.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
I owe you something.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Eight-thirty?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
I don't know. For helping me out.
I don't have much time. 
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
You work too hard, you know that?
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
No way.
I just did.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
I'm not going to do it.
It's all right. I really do know them.
Now ask him who his mother was.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
A thousand.
Is that your third question?
You done your math right.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
Those aren't the facts that matter.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
And the next one...?
Pretty darn clear.
Tht was summation, Your H...
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Like you couldn't believe.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Carl Heine came.
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
The knife.  What knife?
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
He had no reason to.
I can't speak for him.
Such as?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Bye.
Those two musicians from the garage!
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Quiet - I'm thinking.
I told you - it's a sure thing.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
We're not too late, are we?
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
They got the bull-fiddle.
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
As far away as possible.
And I'm Daphne.
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
Watch it, Daphne!
Now you've done it!
Now you tore the other one.
Polish?
Good night, Josephine.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
He's going to be ashore with you.
You can both go take a flying jump.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
You think he's too old for me?
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Get me Room 414.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
We're not on the pier yet -
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
Good night, honey.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
That's ridiculous.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Yes.  For a whole year.
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
- you got to be blonde -
Help yourself.
You don't say.
Why?
I'll throw up!
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
Why?
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
It's not the backs that worry me.
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Oh.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Every time!
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
About what?
What's in Florida?
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
I don't think so.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
It's all right for a bachelor.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
You're flattering me.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Oh, no!
What is it?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Thank you.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Booze.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
I already told you.
Spats Colombo.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Except it’s Scotch.
What? Why? What do you mean?
Sure, disappear. We’ve been walking away our whole lives.
Actually, I do.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Oh, don’t be that way.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Mom, please.
I’m a hooker.
I had to say something to get you here.
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Oh, hello.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Hello, Katmandu.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
It’s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It’s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don’t know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
I don’t know.
You’re too good for him.
Why?
A weekend?
That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
Shampoo, got it!
First of all, it’s never out of the blue. And second of all--
What?!
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Okay.
Sure, but it’s never easy. They say they’re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they’re not.
Desperation?
I didn’t say he was worth it.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Hi.
Thank you.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
You knew?
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Of course, don’t be silly.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Sometime, but not like this.
Uh huh...
Colored.
Sure--
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
Yes mam...
Yes, mam...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
He'll show up one day.
I think so...
Where was you, Daddy?
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Come here, son...
Thank you, Daddy...
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
My father taught me...
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
That's right!
Yes mam...
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
Children, come here...
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
No mam -- I looked all over.
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Did you find your father?
It's the heat.
He can't get up, Mama!
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
I'm used to it.
They probly thought you was crazy.
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
Tired.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
Little chilly.
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Doggy.
I said -
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
How the fuck should I know!!
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
What Cartman?!
Whoops.
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
Something big, children.
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
Oh no, it's that kid.
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Baba mama!
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
Kay.
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Are you sure, Kenny?
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
Huh?
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
Oh God... What have I done...
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
I sure did, Phillip!!
Cheers, Terrance!
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Hey, relax guy!
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Anna...
It can't be.
It certainly is.
They are awaiting further information.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Just don't move around too much.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
Taylor!  Where are you?
Barnes?
I'll do my best.
We have room!  Let's go!
And so far.
Marry you?
Try not to think about it.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
That is one of my priorities.
How am I supposed to know?
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Nope.
He's my dad.
When you get a chance.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
That game was before you was born.
Grace Skinner.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
The small ball.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
What's it look like to you?
I didn't think so.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
I couldn't care less.
He says that to all his wives.
See ya 'round Maynard.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
Hello, mom?
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Who's there?
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Junior who?
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
You made me hurt him!
Someone wants to play with me?
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Line up where you want it.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
They suspended me.
He's my father, Millie.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
Really? I kinda like it.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
More than you could afford.
I could let them go for ten.
...lane six. Yes.
Too late for what, Sheila?
Why not?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
It's Junior, isn't it.
He's my father.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
We would have sooner or later.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Please, Dr. Levine.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
How long will that be?
Yeah.  I heard you.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
He's right beneath us.
Pull it, damn it!
Press?  No, I haven't.
They didn't tell me anything.
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
What team?
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
I don't know.  That's the point.
I think I do.
She should've known better.
When was this?
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Nothing, sir.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
Yes, Harry.
What?
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
What's the message?
She's not gonna know, sir.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
She's not gonna know.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
What is it?
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
What sub?
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
That's quite a secret.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Yeah.  Drowning.
Get this thing off me.
Beth.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
So what?
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
What?
In case you die, too?
The refridgerator.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
What?
What?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
You think, in the sphere --
But how?
But why is he doing it?
Tarazine?
How fast does it take effect?
Where are you?
What do you mean, different?
I'm feeling better.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You tell me.
Don't you?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
No, he isn't.
No, he can't.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
Is it?
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
But I have to, Norman.
It's either this... or I kill you.
Get away from the door, Beth.
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
You'd have to ask them.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Another attack?
Fine.  I'm fine.
I'm not being defensive.
Look, would you --
Whatever I can do to help.
Gimme another explanation.
Then what, Norman?
What is it, Harry?
What are they?
Wisconsin?
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
You know what it is, Harry.
I don't think so.
Hold on.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
You got her?
No idea.
Wait!
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
That's right.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Please.  It must have flown here --
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
No, they didn't say --
Huh?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Like what?
You mean a picture?
Please, Ted.
The creature?
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Unless it's an act.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
I know that.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
Could I learn to feel it?
How can you store an energy field within you?
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
He can't find Organa Major.
You mean we should go after her!...
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
What's that?
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Why?
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
They'll find its weakness.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I read you sir.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
It's what I deserve.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Yes, sir !
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Ace of spades.
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
Zander, please... Let's go !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
So who's got time to get married ?
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
You're upset, that's alright.
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Your turn...
Why not ?
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Who cares ?
I'll go for that.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
That was just a mix up.
What happened to your eye ?
How come we never got together ?
Guess you gotta go.
Flip six, three hole.
What ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Looks like rain.
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
I won't quit !
Here in Buenos Aires.
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Hi, mom.
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Move out.
Not a problem.
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Uh, I don't know.
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir !
V'ger is that which programmed me.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
The Creator has not answered.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
That is how V'ger will survive.
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
This served the purpose.
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
Decker....!
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Viewer, standard ahead.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Hold relative position here...
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Mr. Decker... ?
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Helm ready, sir.
I'll be there.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
What's it called?
I beg your pardon?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
And likewise.
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
<u>Yes</u>...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Never saw the point of 'em.
Better idea...
One moment.
The other side.
Why?
I can't get it to come out right.
It used to be the Old Mill.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
Going home.
Is it...
I'd love to.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
You know what else a man can do?
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Oh yeah.
Now you're talking...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
I'm going to tell the truth.
Water or mineral deposits.
What are they offering?
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
We'll work it out...
Well, then, what's he doing here?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
Fifteen hands.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
What'll I do for fun?
I <u>know</u> my lines...
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I'm having dinner with W...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
We've got three days to...
Everybody needs a hob...
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
I wasn't in the car.
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
Why?
Who is that...?
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
We, we have to give it.
He treated me as if I were a child...
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
She won't stop crying...
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Main Street.
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
No.  No, but we're planning to.
Yes.
You should.
You bet he did.
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
I grew up on your mov...
I hurt my finger.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
The girl was in the car.
I can write it.  I can't type it.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
They're coming Fedex...
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
If you do the product placement...
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
Sherry, Sherry...
And we're glad to have you here...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
It takes all kinds.
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I killed her!
Mommy's marrying Rache!
I don't care.
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Sex.  Of course.
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
Or blush.  You look pale.
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Well.  It's for you.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
Not with my mouth open.
Maybe twenty.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
I'll miss you so much.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
Thank God for that!
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
That's so weak.
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
There you are!
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
What honey?
Is that like Luigi's?
Mom...?
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Rache says it's from you.
You dying.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Every day.  More and more.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
I'm here.
We're not discussing your age.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Just not to me.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Nobody likes a snoop.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
You're not dying.
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
Ironic, huh?
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
Brad Kovitsky.
Thanks, but it's under control.
No.
Worked.  Like a charm.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Double.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Uh.  You hate my guts?
What do I have that you don't?
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
We have to talk.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
I trust you of course I do but --
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Rache, get out of th...
It's no biggie.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
By way of saying you were unhappy.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
I'm gonna get me a drink.
What?
What?
Thanks, Scoob.
I'll be your guest!
Yes, Mikey?
I'm always working.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
He's dead.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Yes, I do. I love them!
Nothing, I guess…
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
You started filling out your college applications yet?
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Is everything OK?
Fine.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
The same.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Say, Ni...
Say, 'Nigger.'
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Hello, is this Pam?
Oh, fine. How are you?
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Yeah. I know.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Oh.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Y-yes--
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
There's the fence...
Because I'll be firing at them.
I guess not Cooper...
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I'll let the senator tell you.
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
How much do they have?
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
At his office in the Capitol.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
What?
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
That's government property, Major.
What is your name, young lady?
No, sir.
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
Yes, sir.
I know that, sir.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
Why can't you cancel it?
How many planes did we lose?
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Speed?
Call them every five miles.
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Forget it.
Primary trigger switch.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Hell, he looks dead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Look, this is different.
But I get a red light.
I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
But who would be chosen?
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Knock yourself out.
Yeah.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Yeah.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
What's it about?
Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Where are you-hoo?
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
No.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
Really?
In what way?
Buff is funny. God.
I can come visit?
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Are you talking to me?
Glad it's okay.
Good. See you later.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
No, no, whoa!
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
A reel?
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
What'd he get you?
Oh, yeah?
It's nice to do a lot of things.
I'm not a nice guy.
Taking care of business.
Funny shit, man.
Thank you.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
No.
What?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
You don't know?
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
I hate that.
No.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Yeah.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
No, no.
Mm.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
I, yeah.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
So how's college?
Yeah, really.
Well, not exactly.
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
Burnfield. No place like it.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Look at you!
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Hey.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah.
Alright!
Mine too.
That's because I am.
I think I gotta go.
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Whatever.
Don't do that.
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
I'm here.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Hey, Tim.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
You know the fuck not.
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
Look, it's really not my fault.
Sorry, Kansas...
Cleo!
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Bullets.
Or, I could get my own horse...
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Thanks!  That'd be great.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Maybe we can make a deal.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
I didn't mean to --
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Thank you.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Life can be beautiful!
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
We're engaged.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
Second generation, huh?
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Twenty-two.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
Whose house is it?
Whose?
Why did she call me?
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
It's a good script, isn't it?
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Fair enough.
They'll love it in Pomona.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
You can stay here.
I'll take care of that.
Just a scene I cut out.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
I don't need a tuxedo.
A little.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
I think I'll read a little.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
No, they don't.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Dressed for what?
Madame is waiting.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
You know better than to interrupt me.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
But where?
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Eliminate her.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
I'm taking you to the hospital.
You love me?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Tell me where I can find her.
No.
Terrific.
Just like that?
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
Yes.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
I don't want your help.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Can I quote you?
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
As brave as my father. As wise.
This is all your clothes?
She's a beast.
Must've been a defective puck.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Not yet.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
I knew it!
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
There's no vodka in it.
Brad.
The kid needs a man to show him --
Clark.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
It sure is.
Too much mayonnaise?
You thought that?
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
Call me.
Oh. You're going away.
What's that?
Gus Gorman.
Nope, but --
Thirty-five.
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
What about this week's check?
Say what?
Or socks.
I'm tryin' to.
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Which country?
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
First question got to be "Where."
God, that's what I keep you for.
KRYPTONITE!
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Fair's fair.
For what?
We've already got some.
What will it do?
Tell me more...
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
We gonna crash?
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
I didn't have my camera with me.
We've already met.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Hey, I know a lot of things!
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Turn on the light.
Missing????
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Don't bet on it!
She'll be fine.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Lois, you're amazing.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Say you love me.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
Wrong.
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
I asked the right question.
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
Constantly.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
What do you want?
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
If you say so. Here goes.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
I'm not so sure you do.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Stuff it.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Who?
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Something . . . wonderful.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
First, I have fun.
What do you fear?
Destiny.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
Lois isn't here?
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
I know son, I know...
Actually, she's silver-haired.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
But otherwise it's swell.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
I didn't say a word.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
But so is Vond-El
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
He will be odd, different.
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
I came to talk to you.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
You think they're strange?
Very much.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
On radio waves?
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Are you still in touch?
I will.
I'll tell her that.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?
Why?
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
C'mon, you know that won't...
Good night.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
Berry-picking.
What's that, Dolores?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
Hi, Dolores.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
No.  A little sugar though.
Isn't it a lovely day?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
It's interesting.
No.  What's this lawyer business?
It's the truth.
That's what he said.
So he was mean?
Oh.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
I object to that form of question. Note that.
People who will help our cause.
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
No.
Almost three.
So what's the problem?
Yes.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Well, let's see what we get.
Who did they get for that?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
You remember that much?
Before the actual accident?
Yes, I understand.
Dolores was driving too fast.
Really?
You and Mom have a lawyer?
But you didn't lose me.
Nothing.
As opposed to this T.V.?
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
I don't know.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
There's talk of that.
The Ottos.
Hitler!
Thanks, I see him...
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Why, has he bothered you before?
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Why?
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Now don't kid a kidder.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
I don't?
Are you finished?
When?
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
But not for anything I did today...
Talk to her yourself...
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
What sort of thing?
He wants me to break a leg?
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Take a top coat.
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
It is a favor, isn't it?
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Now listen to me very carefully.
I would.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Drive faster.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
I love you, John.  I always have.
Go!  I'll finish here.
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
So do you.
Then what?
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
I don't know.
But I promised your mother.
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Five minutes.
Why not show Dr. Furtwängler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
and totally irrelevant.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Your manner.
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
I have a duty.
Yes.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
What is this, Emmi?
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
He did?
One of my people?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Nope.
Right. Claims assessor.
First oboe.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Alright!
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
I won't let the fat kid down.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
The what?
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Okay.  Talk some more.
About where you're from.
That's not my mission.
You must have had a fun child-
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
No.  I'm not.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Yes.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
It was an accident.
Oh, no... you.
He's turning blue!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
How do you know that's the way?
It was a gift... from my brother.
You first.
My hero.  Let's go.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
... two hundred dollars a toe.
I think not.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Seriously?  What did they say?
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
Who the fuck cares?
Scams, con games.  How many?
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
Stop talking to them!
Shut up!
Stop it!
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Boyfriend?
Which grad-school?
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
Fun?
This isn't an escort service?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
Really?
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
There's nothing to forgive.
Of course, Nick...
I hope.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
What is?
A game?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
It was a different floor then...
Like, this way... sort of...
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I'm just like him.
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
It was a misunderstanding.
You know you can.
You warm my heart.
Uh... Nell Vance...
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Greetings.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Sure.
Go ahead.
There's a carriage house around back.
Do we still get paid for the week?
It's a question.
Just stay there, Nell!
Luke.
All night?
Where in the hell can she be.
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
But there's a sad catch to the story.
It was very specific.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
It was.
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
No --
What?
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Nell, what do we do?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Oh!  You scared me.
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
No, it's getting worse.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Well?
I have a loft.
Then what good is he?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
What kind of food?
Why?
Like you.
Oh, god.
I'm sorry.
Sure.
We all did.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Okay.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
Eduardo.  Rama.
Round about, yeah.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Not me, man.
And that's where you met Jenny.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
Faith.
What post office?
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Not her brand.
Try calling me again.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Not ashamed.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Why not.
Have you ever known me not to be.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
What'd your father do?
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
And that is?
Ian?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
I got half.
Good luck.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
I don't know.
So what.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
I doubt it.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Ah.
Ann. Will you come in?
Yes, Ann?
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
We've certainly missed you.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Birdy--
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
And how do we share--
I'll have it in a week.
Cash.
Uh-huh.
Look, uh... Creighton...
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm.
Told what?
Honey?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
So?
Congratulations, Gina.
How are you?
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
Honey...
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
...I don't think so.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
Sure you don't need one?
OK. Boy. Jesus!
So--
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
That's very generous.
Uh-huh.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Not an owner.
Homicide.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
It better be good.
No.
Anything missin'?
Why not?
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
Calm down.  I found it!
Where the hell are you?
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
Call me Vince.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
What is it?
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Quiet.
Another storage room.
Frock's been fired.
It's reptilian.
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
How about lunch?
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
Maybe not.
And John?
You were going to be married.
A monster?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
The planetarium!
It's scared of me.
I have to shoot.
No, hold back...
What music?
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
I'm the creator.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
You think she'd go through with it?
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
I...I can't.
You think so?
--Truman, what are you doing here?
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
I told you I can't.
This is where it started.
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
It's a surprise.
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
I won't be late.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
I don't know--
What?!
You hate gambling.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
Truman, stop it!
Well, I made it through another night.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Things always do--when you look back.
When you get to Fiji?
Who?
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
Sorry. Don't have one.
When was that?
Yes. I know.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
Yes.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
There are complications.
No. Don't bother.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
No you didn't.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
I'd been told as much.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
It looks pretty green for this climate.
I have no idea.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
General McAddie's.
And they want to blame us?
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
I'm not taking any chances.
I have answers for you.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
Lucien Baines?
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Shush.
No.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Why did we stop?
He needs to be turned over.
What's wrong?
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
It doesn't have much to do with science.
What happened to Charles Gish?
What difference does it make...?
I got it.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
That hoist, with the winch...
You're kidding me.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
Sometime yesterday morning.
I'll get her...
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Absolutely.
No.
No.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Yes.
Whiskey.
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Tell you what?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
What's the matter?
Wait here.
What are you going to do?
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
Oh...
How did you know I would be here?
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Oh, the usual things...
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
They're Harry's.
And my passport?
No.
It wasn't important.
Two weeks ago.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Just around the corner.
No.
Best thing that ever happened...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Getting around, Martins.
You're not locking her up?
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
I'm not asking you to.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
How about the doorway?
I said you win.
I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
No, a major, were you really?
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
Goodness, that's awkward.
What about?
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
I told the police.
You wouldn't do anything.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Here?
What did he say?
How do you do.
I have guests waiting.
Hear the details.
English?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
Mr. Lime - yes.
Who else?
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Never.
Yes?
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I don't think so.
Why?
So?
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
It's on an island that no one get to.
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
So?
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
Who the fuck are you?
Then I won't bring you....
I don't, but...
I have a job.
People still need values, beliefs....
I don't care about money.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
I told you, I'm good at this.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
And be crushed.
I'm stealing it.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
What??!?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Are all Jews the same?
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
So you're saying it's not true.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
No.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
The arguments, anyway.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
But I wasn't.
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Yes!
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
That's meat.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
Dennis Leary.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
But your man isn't quite a God!
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
... So am I.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
I think I'll have a coffee.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
No.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
That idiot!
Lira?
Six seconds.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
... You married?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Not at all!
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
Thank you.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Thank you, thank you very much!
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
I don't know... why?
Lucky I was there to save you.
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Absolutely positive.
You'll understand.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
It's my apartment.
Louis, we were French!
What?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
Way past it.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Yes... It's magic.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Coffee might be nice.
... Yes?
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
What's up?
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
What do you want me to do?
Please, call me Mordechai.
Sure. Why not.
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
Mordechai!
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Good looking?
Nice fellow?
It don't look like a leopard to me.
I don't know.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
You found the leopard!
What arroyo -— how did you get to it ——
That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
Go on -—
Let me see it ——
Tomorrow -—
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too —— when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret —— a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
Just barely possible - - yes.
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ——  Don't you?
I thought they came right past here ——
Thanks, Sheriff.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I thought -— is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
When will they be back?
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
I’m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
You drive a hard bargain.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
Have you got a pen?
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Have you finished?
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What’s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
Leon could still have hung himself.
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They’ll tell you. Call them!
I wouldn’t mind. Thank you.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Have we done business before?
Yes... Good, good...
I see. How much?
...On holiday?
No... No...  I swear...
What?
I don’t know. I don’t know, man. I don’t even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, you’ve got to get me out of here...
Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
B-Black...
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
La what?
It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
I hope it’s not too significant.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
My rates...
We conclude our transaction.
Does it matter?
I don’t know what your problem is, but...
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
Should I come back in five minutes?
The lady’s not a friend. She’s a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger’s on the trigger, you hear!
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon’s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Oh, I... She just moved. I’ve got her new... It’s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
He’d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... ‘Sleeping Beauty’. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn’t watch...
Er... Yes...
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn’t... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... “Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,” Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
Los Angeles?
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
What about his girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Tu sais où me trouver.
Eh bien... T’es sûr que t’as besoin de moi?  La petite m’a l’air assez bien foutue, non?
Then why don’t you reach him?
Shut up and walk...
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
What’s that? A word?
My lord, I'm not sure that...
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Now?
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
Tell me...
It would not be the same without you.
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
We want her burned as a witch!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Yes...
No... I want to be confessed.
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
I understand.  How much?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
I'm... I'm not the king...
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Go and ask him yourself.
His face.
Yes.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
The wind will be against us...
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Damn right!
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
I... submit to Our Lord.
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
I said, kneel!
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
No.
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
Yes... lots of things!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
No...
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Whose were they?
Jeanne, be patient.
Oh, yes. I remember.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
Wladek, please.
Wladek, please.
He'll be back before curfew.
I'll be fine.
What, I'm working, what?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
What?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
We use what?
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
They were taking you away.
Yes, that's why I brought it.
Yes, but what good did it do?
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
Toilets?
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You made contact?
Not yet.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Watch your feet!
Watch his hand
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
Ohh the tag is broken.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
No.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
Do I know any gigs?
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
No.
Here.
Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Don't worry about it, pal.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
You think my play is bad?
If that's the way you want it.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Shove off, Duff.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
Which one?
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
What about the other one?
Who's got the contract?
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
We'll get by without 'em.
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Then you'll do it?
Neither are we.
If we ever get to it.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Yeh.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
Raise 5,000.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
But what about all these other people?
Think nothin' of it.
Where's June today?
Where you goin'?
No.
What the hell for?
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
Okay, Tootsie.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
Then why the rat?
I am after this race.
You're a lucky man, all right.
Why don't ya then.
I'm in.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Come on, gimme a break.
You know how they are... sex...
Is that what it means?
It's all right.
Just a minute...
Said he stole his invention.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Give it to me.
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I didn't.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
What do you mean?
Yes.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
Disappeared!
tried him once -
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
I've got to see you alone!
Where did you hit her?
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
I'm very interested in that body.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Gilbert!
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
No.
Man to man, I'm not.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
I think we're on the right track.
Nunheim!
He did!
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
No.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Want to take a poke at him?
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
You've said that for weeks.
Never mind.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
You're going to return every cent of it!
Yes?
No.
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Hello, Mimi.
What do you think?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
Yes...
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
That last Martini.
Santa Claus.
What are you drinking?
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Yes.
That's jolly.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
I'll get some towels. 
Want a drink?
No.  It's a Christmas present.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
I did find him!
That's a fact.
Sure.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Mimi...
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
Yes.
Yes.
Maybe she has.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I'm fired.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Let me see the map.
Then get up and do something about it.
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
Why'd he come in our camp.
He's an enemy soldier.
What if I do?
We thought--
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
There might be something in there.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
It's the only way.  We drive!
...I know.
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
Mine.  Land mine!
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
It's a fire fight.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
Something like that.
Just stay down.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
Is it dead?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
We'll find our way!  We'll...
Yeah.  Well, me too.
You still got a map on you?
Makes two of us.
Damn.
It's got to be going better than this..
Don't you touch it.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Somebody has to.
Yeah.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
For real?  A treasure?
I could.
Naw, nothing.
It doesn't mean anything.
What!?
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
How the hell should I know how much?
Oh, Jesus!
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
Yeah, we're down.
I think we found something.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
Eat your dinner.
Look,dirt!
Looks like dirt.
I don't want to lose you.
Don't let them separate us.
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
THX and me.
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
I want you for my roommate.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
What?
What kind of answer is that?
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
No!....
I'm only trying to help you.
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Yes...
Thanks.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
Then let's go see what they missed.
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
What?
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Your partner?
Where you guys at?
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
I don't know.
Easy, guys.  
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
We've created a monster.
Who is he?
Shut up!  Who is this?
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Look, it's important.
What kind of bomb was it?
Insurance?
I don't know...
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
Yeah, just a nick ...
It's about this.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Huh?
IRA - instant retirement account.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
I promised her she'd be safe.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
So you lost a handbag, madame?
And diamonds in the front.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
Amsterdam?
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Yes, Baron.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Um-hum!
No, not at all!
I've got to see you.
What is it?
M'sieu Monescu!
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
No, thank you.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Seven and nine!
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
What?
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Not particularly.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Too much blue in crimson.
No. What is it? Tell me.
This used to be my secretary's room.
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
You're hired!
Together.
Like that?
You're conceited--
I <u>must</u> go.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
And you expect me to believe that?
But it could have been glorious.
Yes--uh--
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
How much is your salary?
I don't want your money!
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
An hour, two at most.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Lewis...
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
Rose Calvert.
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
So do I.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
Bollocks.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
We've struck ice.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
I've got you. I won't let go.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Is he your boyfriend?
Just some sketches.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
She had beautiful hands.
I see you.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
A mistake?
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
To the stars.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
He couldn't have.
It's so cold.
I can't feel my body.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Sure!
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
This is Miss Marsh.
I can explain--
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
Glad to see you again.
We'll save you a place at our table.
Isn't that interesting?
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
We'll be expecting you.
Not at all.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
And me coming in with two pair-- 
I'll say she is!
Very much--
I could stand some more--
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
You work too fast for me, young man.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
I'll be there--Good-by.
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Lose?--I won a little--
I'll be waiting on deck.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
--there's thousands of 'em!
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Now you're talkin'!
You take some awful chances.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Partners, ain't we?
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
It's a pleasure.
I'll go with you--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
Coming to the pool for a swim?
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
What's that?
What'll I say?
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Sure.
Knots!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
So what?
I thought I put you to bed.
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's fine.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
I'll never love anybody else.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Meaning what?
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Not a chance--I'm through. 
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
"Smooth's" the word.
What's the matter?
Telegrams.
Isn't that a daisy?
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Not now.  I don't have time.
I don't understand.
Where do you think?  I stole him.
And you must be Doc Holliday.
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
Good.  That's real good.
This brand.
No...
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
I'll remember you said that.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
No...
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
All right, Doc...
All right.  Then what?
Not half as bad as I feel.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
I know.  Me neither.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
What about her?
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
I think I'll just lie down awhile
I need it.
You wanted to talk?
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Morg, use your head.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
They're carrying guns in town.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
I can feel your pain.
Sightseeing.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Not from forty feet.
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Who knows? Fog, night...
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
I didn't think so.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
What?
What do you mean?
Trust me.
Are you listening to me?
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
Of course.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Stop it!
I am. What do you want?
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
No -
Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
Approaching the first gate.
Get more men up there!
It's Bond!
Thank you sir! Thank you!
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Maybe. Maybe not.
You always got something to say.
Will you still get the money from your father?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
What for?
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Let me get you a cup?
Good afternoon to you.
You must have done something to her.
Hattie is a different person now.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
I already have, my dear.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Whadda ya think?
No, I haven't seen him.
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Where?
Trouble?!  Where?!
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Go away.
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Hold still, Buzz!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Oh no, Hannah!
She's sick!
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
A lunchbox...?!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
I thought he was at summer camp!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.

Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Slink!  Hang on!
Excuse me.
I did like the music.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
She got away.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Go away.
I finished it off.
Did you now.
So had I.
Nothing is left but us.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
It's all right, Finn.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Nine thousand dollars.
Why are you talking like that?
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
She asked me not to.
No, not yet.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
What do you think?
Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
Yeah.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
I don't know.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
No --
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
So go shower already.
Yes, sir!
I don't know, sir.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
But will he be house-trained?
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Any idea how much?
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
She hasn't called you?
We sometimes went downtown to score.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Thanks.
What?
Shut up.
Out.
And don't make any noise.
Are you clean?
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Smells like it.
So why have you told me about it?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Fuck, OK.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Oh, really?
It's no problem.
Aye.
No, I'm clean.
And you might get the fucking job.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
So who else?
What about The Untouchables?
Give me the gun.
What?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
When are you going to visit him?
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
Six weeks.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
So what's it going to be?
But where?
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Then I shall make use of this starship.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Have the Klingons responded?
What do you know of my pain?
Join my quest.
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
I don't understand.
Yes, Spock?
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
What do you mean?
Captain, what have I done -
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
I have a half brother.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
Is what possible?
A "t."
Hmmm?
Not possible. You were never alone.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
Am I? We'll see.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
  

Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
I hide no pain.
I belong here.
You haven't told him?
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Hello, Alan.
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I'm sorry -
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
If you think -
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
How about you?
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Recognizers!
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
You're getting out of the business?
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
As long as it gets us out of here
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Where are you going?
Yeah, right.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
You're kidding.
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Yep.  Sleep fast.
Here, check these out.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Yeah, right.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
I'll just hang then, shall I?
I still don't believe it.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
But you didn't.  Why not?
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, sir.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Me too.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
I'll handle it.
They must've just missed me.
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
Answer the question--
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
Sure, hon.
You wouldn't believe me.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Yup.										*
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
I understand.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
I'm married!
I just glances inside.
How come?
Get it.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Sure. Why not?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
What do you want to know?
What would make you think that?
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
What?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
What?
What?
How come?
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
He don't got no right to live.
I don't blame you.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
She's with me.
I'm her husband.
Get the fuck outta here!
Now tell him goodbye.
Every word of it.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Where?
What's to think about?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Want an animal cracker?
He trusts you?
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
No problems on both counts.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
That's about all I ever eat.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Do you still have friends on the force?
I'm your son.
No shit?
I got some money I can give you -
I give up. Who are you?
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
McTeague.
Uh-huh.
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
This guy's gonna kill him.
Rock whores.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
- Because it's good!
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you know where we can find him?
Where's that?
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
I need to go now.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
What year is it?
No, 1995 is the past.
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
Give me the gun.
It was?  I didn't...know.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
I need to make a telephone call.
I'm here about some monkeys.
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
How did you find me?
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
He's been tested for drugs?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
I'll be right here...just in case.
Might be tight.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
You want something?
Christ no!
Yeah, yeah.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
More or less.
Hundred and eight already.
Will be.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Just a car.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Yeah, you better remember that.
Open up!
It is morning.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
I think I burned my gun hand!
John . . .
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
What do you want?
Who the hell is this!?
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I just drove in this morning.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
I guess it must.
Like you.
Like they're made of polyester.
I have ideas.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You just walk away.
Where?
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
I don't know.
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Funny thing.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
You heard me.  Count it out.
He was going to--
You could give me the gun.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Accident.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
Just ran into a little trouble.
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
About what you said this morning.
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
Do we shake hands?
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
All I have in the world.
No.
Darrell giving you problems?
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
You came to take my wife from me?
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Come on, Jake--
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
I've had time to get over it.
You're too quick for me.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
What the hell are you talking about?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Stand up.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Jesus!
I guess.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
No!
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I said I was sorry.
Who's cursed?
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
You afraid of the dark?
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Give it to me!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Like you don't know.
I was hoping we could talk.
I do.
I did?
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You love her, but you hate her?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
It's the truth, Jake.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Yeah, I can fix it.
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
I want my car.
Do you have to call me that?
It's Grace.
You should be more careful.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
Is it pretty?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Can you make it back up?
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
Which you don't have.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
The ticket is 30.55.
Sure, I'll try.
What was that all about?
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Wrong number.
There's someone in the house.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
He's asleep.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
You use your sleeve.
Yes.
Rust?
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
You assumed wrong.
You've misunderstood.
We've already begun.
You're skill.
We are.
Yes he is.
I want to sleep here tonight.
What things?
I'll help you.
Get mom.
I see.
Elijah was wrong.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
You want... a free one.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Shit and fried eggs.
Those cowboys messin' him up?
Property.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
Yup.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
And?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Lookin' at?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
What business?
Well... I don't recollect.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Yup.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Eleven.
Two weeks, I guess.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Tom?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
What?
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Bear with me here...
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
They'll never stop.
Umm ...
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
You are a criminal.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
Can we stealth these guys?
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Did you hear what he just said?
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
Maybe more.
Not if we do it my way.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Neither do we.
Tell him we'll meet.
What'the fuck is that?
Two hours, tops.
Kobayashi.
I'm not a rat.
He loved her.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
Give a guy a break, huh?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
I don't.
I never heard of him.
I don't
Edie.
Because he was my friend.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Yes.
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
I'm on the staff of...
Objection.
You may step down.
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
I . . ..
I...
I thought I would need it.
Why is that?
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
There's nothing they can do to me.
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
You're going to settle out of court?
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
I'm sure you would.
Thank you for seeing me.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
From the magazine?
And what are you?  A cop?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
What...?
You're talking like a drunk.
Is there going to be a later...?
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
What?
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
Right.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Yeah.
Read me what she said.
The 'History'...?
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
You live in the neighborhood?
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
Thanks, Franky.
As I've said we had some more...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh.  And why is that?
Should I?
Me, too.
I married into it.
No, I'm all right.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
No.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
What about?
You won't have to.
No, you don't owe me anything.
Dinner... and what else?
An hour?
Don't go.
No.
Yes.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Yes.
To complete my cure.
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
Scottie --
No! Let me go!
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Where had you been before?
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
I... didn't know where you lived.
My name is John Ferguson.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Shopping?
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
No, thank you.
Yes...
Vaguely...
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
All the time.
Only this far.
Yes?! But --
No, never!
Madeleine!!
I won't lose you.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
How long has she had the room?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Would you please go and look?
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Ah, Johnny-O...
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
That's following a train of thought.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
How?
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
You haven't told me everything.
Carlotta?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Oh?
Wandering.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Can we have it by tonight?
I didn't hear you.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
She's dead.
And you're a little fucking reject.
You go home!
You want to hear me out?
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
There's more.
Sure, why not.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Have you ever done this before?
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
What does that mean?
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
I can't do this.
I don't give a damn.
Adam! Calm down.
It has worked.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
What?
No. I think it's fucked.
What happened? Oh my God...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
So where's that leave us?
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Where is she?
The groom?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
She's still working?
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Here's his head.
Give me two more.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
Good God...Good God...
I'm talking about prayer.
What did you ask me?
Exactly! Exactly my point.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
What does that mean?
Yeah.
Fine? Fine what?
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell you didn't!
You hate women.
You have a King fantasy.
What's your point?
What?
Not really, no.
You said nobody would miss her.
We're not goosed.
Goosed!
Goosed!
I love you.
We missed the deadline.
Sent it.
Yup.
Yes.
Why what?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
Well it's bad timing.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
What are you talking about?
It's vile!
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Problems?
I'm not. What's the problem?
Okay.
Are they fighting?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
I won't even discuss it.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
You did all right dad.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Yup.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
...embarrassing, shameful...
Take your time. I wish I had.
So where to on the honeymoon?
That's right.
Two.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
That one.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
Don't you ever see him?
Today I can refuse you nothing.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
Yes, sir. Good night.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Yes.
Fifteen yards.
That's it.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
She's left.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Why not?
A black bull came.
You little liar! Get out of here!
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
When you are, miss.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
No, I don't want to.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
I'm getting by.
I've seen worse.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Only because I got pulled out early.
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
I was assured the problem was corrected.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
I'M WHAT?!
Do I get to see it or not?
It feels so.. .real.
Turn it down!
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was me, what?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
Start of what?
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Part of him is.
Thanks.
Lindenmeyer?
I couldn't tell you.
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Why's that?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
What are you talking about?
For Schumann.
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?

It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
....we landing?
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
Who would find out?
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
...I just hope...
...take a long view.
<u>So</u> forth...
Due in Nashville.
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
To preserve their Way of Life.
I have.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
Why Albania?
Is that true?
...that's what it is.
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
They got him standing by.
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
All the greater accomplishment.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
Is he dead?
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...
Keep Talking....
Why are they ...
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...  Gemme the Pentagon.  List of people in all Military Special Programs.... Left behind.  Like the Old Shoe... Johnny: "Good Old Shoe"... 
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
...they... <u>you</u> know...
...for the beans, yes...
Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
Show some compassion.
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Please, no thanks... 
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
How's Mom?
Alright. Why so pissed?
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
I met them before you were born.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
You speak for me, son.
What are you doing here?
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
What'd you tell him?
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
He never told me...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
Yes...
I don't understand.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
...I can't make it tonight.
Gordon.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Upper West Side.
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
Yeah, yeah, OK
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Who's is all this?
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
I know he does.
Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
Then why did you?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Yes, but...
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Do you?
Have you been hurt?
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
She isn't here.
Who?  Your husband?
Very much.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Claire.
It's fine.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
Stop.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Jody, no...
Please.  That's all I need.
What?
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
The planchette?
Shhh.
M-E...
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
Did he say that?
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
Norman Spencer.
It's Saturday.
We did.
Shhh.
That's not what I'm sug--
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
You are so brilliant.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Huh.
No.  Look!  In the window.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Sweetheart--
I will NOT.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
What's wrong with me?
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
What's the matter?
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Who?
STOP IT!
So you fucked a student?!
You should have tried harder.
Get out of my way.
Shhhh.
Then what is he...?
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
What are you talk---
Then you wear it.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
When did she die...?
I under5tand.  All the same
It wes a dream...!
FAST.
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Always loved you..
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It is from love.
If you knew how I yearn for that...
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
But have I...?  Ever...?!
I love Michael...
I don't know what you are!!!
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
He fools around with his patients too.
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Captain's orders.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
That's GREAT!
Their what...?
Did you see the old man on the ---
That's cause we're below sea level.
That's not funny.
- we made a fire.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
What were you talking about...?
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Gotcha.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Stop it!
If you like that type.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
BRIAN...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
Sure...
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
Yes, one and a half please.
I'm a dentist
And how many people have you killed?
I don't want to talk about it -
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
Out - I may be some time
What was I supposed to do?
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
What's this all about?
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Perv.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
God, I love being dead.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
So you'll think about it?
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
It's my private business! Mine!
Dad, please.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Yeah.
...not the pit.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
It's okay. You need me?
Watch your tone, mister.
They're in the ignition, silly.
Got it.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
What do you want me to do?
You mean they knew who I was?
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
So, what brings you here at his hour?
It's not up to me.
You want it in writing?
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Your article sucked.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
But you never do.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
That's refreshingly deviant.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
Very ambitious. I like that.
Yellow pages?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I was like a different person tonight.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
My job. Back off, Benedict.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
You could tell me where you were last night.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
Lombardo's settlement?
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
I net a guy in a bar.
You could say that.
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
Ray, you heard him...
He dropped Jimmy off first?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
I'm sorry?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, but...
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
Shit.
Whichever one I want.
Where, the mall?
In back of the garage.
Yes.
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
Hello.
Duquette.  Forget him...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
And you believe her?
That's not your line.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
What's that supposed to mean?
That's right.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
That's right.  That was his name.
Story's the same, Detective...
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
And she wanted to talk.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Funny.  So am I.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Put them all together and what do we have?
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Aha?
Starting with a screw?
Prepare what?
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
In the next two minutes?
But it only has six legs.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Your guests, ma'am?
I don't like to lose, either.
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Private train?
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
He had a pressing engagement.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
It is?
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
You managed alright.
Me?
What is Tir Asleen?
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
You're not a woman.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
You hear trouble.
Of course!  I promise!
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
I thought you had her!
Who?
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
The limitless power of...
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
He never misses.
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Shut up.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
How are we going to get out there?
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
They're Amish.
Pick up the hat.
Okay, Mr. Book.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Yeah.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Who else knows?
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Two days.
Something wrong with buttons?
Anything against zippers?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
A real fireball.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
That's your way, not mine.
Where's my baggy pants?
I didn't even know about it.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch – I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Say again?
Not yet.
I don't know where he is.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I have committed no sin.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
No... No. It is just the English way.
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Oh -- all right.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
This?
Hickory!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Why --
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Oh -- yes.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Oh, you....
No --
Stop her!
Did you say something?
...Oh, did that hurt?
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Hah!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Oh, come on.
Huh?  What'd he say?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
They would?
Where's Kansas?
You're going to see a Wizard?
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Oh --
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Ah --
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Fine.  He's got a plan
Yeah. Me?
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Whozat?
Yeah --
Yeah.
Ohhhh -- it's me!
To Oz!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Oh - look out.
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Oh, no!
Go on!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Well, I --
Elektra King.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M’s life is part of the bet.
Elektra would control it all.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Renard.
Indeed.
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
Yes.
It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
Really?
Shush.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
He used your exact words.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
You turned Renard.
Oh James.
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
You are out of your league.  She’s working with Renard.
And the payoff on the tables?
How appropriate.
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Washington?
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Jon, no -- I can't --
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Because --
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Veidt¹s complex.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
What are you up to?
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
I don't think she's coming with us.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
We should get back --  What?
-- What?
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Isn't it true that you --
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Ever see one of these before?
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
Who says you're the good guys?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
What weapons do you have?
He gets to be the hero.
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Yorgi asked me to.
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
When can I see you again?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
You don't have to do that.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Nice place to start, don't you think?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Of course.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
It's too far.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
By reading my thoughts?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
To find Rogue.
I'll go.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
A piece.  Only a piece.
What do you mean to do?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
Yes, my dear, he is.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
No!
Now wait a minute!
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Of course.
Yes.
Yes, don't worry.
Yes.
I promise.
Darling!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
May I have it, please?
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Break that old man's violin.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
No, Fred ereck.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I'm sure we will.
Fro-derick!
Could be worse!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
You've got it, master.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Who are you talking to?
Don't fall for that one.
Act casual!
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
Is everything ready?
It's the only way.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
How nice.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Well...
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Yes!
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
What do you think we should do?
Me?  Sing?
I think so.
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Why don't we talk inside?
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
MMmmm.
There must have been someone else down here then.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Yes.
Food!!
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
Certainly, Sin
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
